52. Prime Minister Modi and President Biden celebrate the historic and active collaboration across the full expanse of our respective health sectors. They welcomed the opportunity for deeper collaboration to secure pharmaceutical supply chains. The leaders encouraged their administrations to continue their strong collaboration on pandemic preparedness, supported by epidemiology training; laboratory strengthening and point of entry surveillance; and food safety and regulation. The leaders applauded collaborations between research institutes of both countries on affordable cancer technology programs, including for the development of AI enabled diagnostic and prognosis prediction tools, and on diabetes research. The leaders committed to holding a India-U.S Cancer Dialogue, hosted by President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot, to bring experts together from both countries to identify concrete areas of collaboration to accelerate the rate of progress against cancer. They also called for expanded collaboration on digital health platforms including responsible use of cutting-edge technologies like AI, and to explore cooperation in research and the use of traditional medicine.

Washington, D.C.

June 22, 2023"
2,https://www.cfr.org/blog/what-did-prime-minister-modis-state-visit-achieve,What Did Prime Minister Modi’s State Visit Achieve?,,"Last week Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi completed a four-day state visit to the United States. Modi was not only feted with a welcome ceremony and state dinner, but was also invited to address Congress for the second time during his prime ministership. These high-profile events were intended to reflect the two countries’ shared commitment to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and signify that the United States sees India as a critical partner. Judging by the attention paid to Modi’s arrival and the deals announced, both countries came away with winning outcomes, singly and jointly.

For India, the honors bestowed on Modi—a man who just a few years ago was denied entry to the United States for his role in the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat—showed to the world that far from being a pariah, he is now the powerful and accepted leader of a valued partner country. The United States also offered concrete wins. The Biden administration promised to help India increase production of electric vehicles and meet its goal of installing 500 gigawatts of wind, solar, and other renewable energy this decade. U.S. memory chip firm Micron Technology will invest up to $825 million in a new chip assembly and test plant in Gujarat, which will be its first factory in India. On immigration, which has been a thorny issue, the United States agreed to allow a small number of Indians on H-1B visas to renew them in the United States without traveling abroad.

The United States too made symbolic and material gains. In terms of symbolic wins, the United States was able to showcase its close partnership with India—a country that also shares its deep anxiety about the specter of a rising China—and highlight the exchange of effusive warm statements between President Biden and Prime Minister Modi a mere two days after the former labelled President of China Xi Jinping a “dictator.” There were also material wins. Indian solar panel maker Vikram Solar Limited will invest up to $1.5 billion in the U.S. solar energy supply chain. India has also agreed to join the U.S.-led Artemis Accords on space exploration and will work with NASA on a joint mission to the International Space Station in 2024. In a huge political win for the Biden administration, India will remove retaliatory tariffs imposed on U.S. products such as chickpeas and apples without the expectation that the United States will remove its own tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that had initially led to these retaliatory tariffs.

Perhaps most importantly, both countries scored wins in their defense and strategic partnership. U.S. company General Electric has signed a memorandum of understanding with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to produce fighter jet engines for the Indian Air Force. While the deal is subject to congressional approval, this is a huge step both for India, which can domestically manufacture fighter jets but not the engines to power them, and for the United States, which is very choosy about the sharing of military technology. Moreover, India’s defense ministry has approved the purchase of armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones (a type of Predator drone) made by General Atomics, which will enhance the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities of India’s armed forces across domains. Currently, only some U.S. allies own Predator drones. The two countries also established a Joint Indo-U.S. Quantum Coordination Mechanism to facilitate joint research between public and private sectors and launched the INDUS-X partnership to expand their strategic technology and defense industrial cooperation. India also agreed to join the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), a U.S.-led partnership with twelve other countries plus the European Union, to create critical energy minerals supply chains.

Finally, and significantly, Prime Minister Modi was also persuaded to take two questions in a joint press conference with President Biden. Although the two leaders sidestepped public critique and offered awkward answers to a U.S. reporter’s question about democracy and human rights (the less-loaded second question from an Indian reporter was about climate change), the fact that Modi, who has not held a press conference in nearly a decade, agreed to respond to reporters at all was a further indication of how important the bilateral relationship has become for both nations."

Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi, wrapped up his three-day state visit to the United States on Friday, June 23, 2023.



The visit was marked by announcements to expand economic engagement and resolve on both sides to elevate the bilateral relationship to a global strategic partnership. During the visit, Modi held a one-on-one conversation with US President Joe Biden ahead of the delegation-level talks. Both leaders affirmed that technology would play the defining role in deepening the partnership between India and the United States. The two leaders also highlighted the significance of the US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership and the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP) to demonstrate their commitment to climate action and clean energy.



Here are some of the major highlights of the visit:

The Indo-US Joint Statement

A joint India-US statement was issued after the visit to announce deals on semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI), telecoms, jet engine manufacturing, drones purchasing, and investments in energy and mobility sectors. The two leaders also affirmed to extend digital partnership and collaboration on sustainable development and global health. During his visit, Modi also met American CEOs from top companies including Google, Boeing, and Amazon and addressed a joint session of the US Congress.

Meeting with top American CEOs and business leaders

Prime Minister Modi interacted with CEOs and business of top American companies during a roundtable at the White House. The meeting was marked by pledges of deeper US-India cooperation on areas including space, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. After the meeting, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the tech giant is investing US$10 billion in India’s digitization fund and announced the opening of its global fintech operation center in GIFT City, Gujarat. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy took to Twitter to announce that the e-commerce giant will invest a total of $26 billion in India by 2030. In a statement, tech giant Microsoft said that its CEO, Satya Nadella, held discussion with PM Modi around the power of technology, particularly artificial intelligence, to help improve the lives of Indians.

Other CEOs present during the roundtable included Sam Altman (OpenAI), Tim Cook (Apple), and Lisa Su (AMD). Earlier, Tesla CEO Elon Musk had also met the Indian Prime Minister soon after he landed in the US.

PM Modi’s address to joint session of the Congress

Prime Minister Modi addressed a joint session of the US Congress. During his speech, PM Modi mentioned the growing Indo-US trade and economic relations and spoke on the rapid steps both countries are taking to boost strategic partnership. Here are some of the quotes from PM Modi’s speech:

Indo-US partnership

“Today, India and the US are working together in space and in the seas, in science and in semiconductors, in startups and sustainability, in tech and in trade, in farming and finance, in art and artificial intelligence.”

Climate actions

“We became the only G20 country to meet its Paris commitment. We made renewables account for over 40% of our energy sources, nine years ahead of the target of 2030. But we did not stop there. At the Glasgow Summit, I proposed Mission LiFE—Lifestyle for Environment. This is a way to make sustainability a true people’s movement.”

Women empowerment

“Today, in modern India, women are leading us to a better future. India’s vision is not just of development which benefits women, it’s of women-led development where women lead the journey of progress.”"

8,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/21/whats-behind-indian-prime-minister-narendra-modis-us-visit,What’s behind Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s US visit?,2023-06-21 00:00:00,"The US is seeking stronger ties with India, which it sees as a vital ally in efforts to contain China’s rise.

The administration of United States President Joe Biden is scheduled to host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an official visit later this week, as the two countries strengthen their ties amid shared antipathy towards China’s growing influence.

The White House will hold a state dinner in Modi’s honour on June 22, a sign of the burgeoning relationship between the two powers who have stepped up cooperation in areas such as trade and arms sales.

In a press release, the Biden administration said that a recent trip to New Delhi by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan “underscored the dynamism of the US-India partnership in advance of Prime Minister Modi’s historic official state visit next week to the United States”.

But human rights groups say the celebratory dinner is a de facto endorsement of India’s far-right turn under Modi’s leadership — and undermines the Biden administration’s stated goal of emphasising human rights and democracy in its foreign policy.

During Modi’s tenure, India’s Muslims and other minorities have experienced an uptick in violence and repression as the government leans into a form of Hindu nationalism known as Hindutva. Modi has also been criticised for seeking to consolidate power and crack down on dissent.

“A state dinner is a special occasion; it’s not something that just any foreign leader receives,” Edward Mitchell, the deputy executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told Al Jazeera over a phone call.

“How can the White House honour a leader who is an open anti-Muslim bigot, a right-wing ideologue who censors journalists and turns a blind eye to lynchings? You can work with India and Modi without taking this extra step to celebrate him.”





Confronting China

While advocacy groups have called for greater scrutiny of India’s human rights record, foreign policy experts say the Biden administration is primarily interested in the country as a potential counterweight to China, which the US sees as its most formidable global competitor.

Sarang Shidore, Director of Studies and Senior Research Fellow at the Quincy Institute, a US-based think tank, told Al Jazeera that he believes the US-India relationship will continue to grow as long as their shared concern over China remains in place.

“The United States does not conduct its foreign policy based on democracy and human rights. It conducts its foreign policy based on its interests, as all states do,” Shidore said.

China’s growing military power and assertive territorial claims have become a source of concern for nearby Asian countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Japan and India. The US has worked to fashion alliances with many of those countries in an attempt to contain China’s expanding influence.

“No question, there is increased Chinese nationalism,” said Shidore. “And China sees India as an increasing challenge due to its relationship with the US.”





Expanding ties

That was not always the case. During the Cold War, India’s relations with the US were often frosty. The country had cultivated close ties with the USSR and helped spearhead the Non-Aligned Movement, an organisation of countries that rejected pressures to join either pro-US or pro-Soviet blocs.

For its part, the US was a key ally of Pakistan. And by the early 1970s, the administration of US President Richard Nixon started to build a cooperative relationship with China, as an attempt, in part, to place pressure on the USSR.

But as the Cold War ended and China’s economic rise became a preoccupation of US foreign policy, India — with its size and economic heft — started to be seen as a key regional ally.

Despite its improved ties with the US, however, India has continued to resist what it sees as a false choice between the US and countries like President Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

But as Russia wages war in Ukraine and Washington seeks to isolate Moscow economically and diplomatically, that balancing act has become more difficult for India to maintain.

While India has increased its purchase of weapons from countries such as France and the US and recently agreed on a roadmap to increase cooperation with the US defence industry, it remains the world’s largest importer of Russian arms.

India has also joined China in buying up Russian oil at discounted prices, while the US and the European Union angle to limit Russia’s power in the global energy market.

But Shidore said that India’s status as a central player in Washington’s Asia strategy gives it significant leverage. Its ties to Russia are not likely to get in the way of its relationship with the US, he explained.

“India has played this quite well, playing Russia and the US off each other, and has benefitted in the process,” he said. “A country like India, which has such a strong convergence with the US on China, can create major spaces where it will differ very strongly from the US and can ride that out.”





Consolidating control

While US relations with allies such as Saudi Arabia and Israel have come under political scrutiny in recent years, Modi’s trip to the US has been welcomed with bipartisan support. An a joint letter inviting Modi to address Congress during his visit, members of the US House of Representatives and Senate have hailed the visit as a sign of the “enduring friendship” between the two countries.

“During your address, you will have the opportunity to share your vision for India’s future and speak to the global challenges our countries both face,” the letter reads.

However, Modi’s human rights record has not gone entirely unremarked. On Tuesday, a group of more than 70 lawmakers from the US House and Senate penned a letter to the Biden urging him to discuss concerns about religious freedom and journalistic expression in his talks with Modi.

The Muslim rights group CAIR, meanwhile, has issued a statement calling on the White House to drop its plans for a state dinner.

Modi’s high-profile reception in the US is a far cry from what he experienced before he was first elected prime minister in 2014. Prior to becoming India’s leader, Modi had been banned from entering the US due to allegations that he turned a blind eye to anti-Muslim violence in the western Indian state of Gujarat in 2002, when he was the province’s chief minister.

The deadly 2002 riots were the subject of a BBC documentary that Modi tried to ban in January, invoking his emergency powers as prime minister. The rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch screened the documentary in Washington on Tuesday.

Human rights groups say the move to ban the film was representative of a larger effort under Modi to stifle dissent and exercise control over independent institutions. They also accuse his government of pursuing an agenda influenced by far-right Hindu nationalism.

In an annual report on religious freedom in May, the US State Department expressed concern about the situation in India, noting that there were “open calls for genocide against Muslims”, lynchings and “attacks on places of worship”.

In May, for the fourth year in a row, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom called on the State Department to designate India as a “country of particular concern”.

In some states controlled by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), politicians who lean into violent anti-Muslim rhetoric face little reprimand. Some Hindu nationalist paramilitaries have also waged a campaign against interfaith marriages, which they portray as an effort to dilute the Hindu population and win converts to Islam through “love jihad”.

Shidore, however, said that Modi’s human rights record has been quickly “papered over” and is unlikely to prevent cooperation with the US, so long as China remains a serious global competitor.

“The United States”, he said, “has set human rights issues aside in order to strengthen ties”."

During the visit, which was only the third state visit of President Joe Biden’s term to date, Biden and Modi discussed shared efforts to mitigate the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine and security in the Indio-Pacific region.

We asked SIS professor Amitav Acharya a few questions about what Modi’s visit to the US could mean for US relations with the world’s most populous nation. He also analyzed how Modi’s visit could impact his re-election campaign heading into 2024."

What is a state visit?

It is a formal visit by a head of state to a foreign country, at the invitation of the head of state of that foreign country. When a leader undertakes a state visit, the head of state of the destination country acts as the former's official host throughout the duration of the trip.

Such a visit always includes a state reception by the host for the guest. US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, too, will host PM Modi for a state dinner.

Also, a state visit is usually reserved only for ‘closest friends and allies.’ It, therefore, signifies the highest expression of friendly bilateral ties between two sovereign nations.

How is a state visit different from an official visit?

The latter involves much less pomp and show than the former. An official visit, also sometimes known as official working visit or working visit, may include an official dinner, which, however, is nowhere near as glittering as a state dinner.

Also, a state visit is usually undertaken by a head of state, and not the head of government. Modi's trip, therefore, is significant as the President is the head of state in India, and the prime minister, the head of government. The US President is both the head of state and government.

Indian leaders and state visits to the US

Before Modi, only 2 Indian leaders have been hosted by the United States as an official state guest: President S Radhakrishnan in June 1963, and PM Manmohan Singh in November 2009.

Overall, as many as 9 Indian PMs have undertaken visits to the US: Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee (4 trips each), Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi (3 each), PV Narasimha Rao (2), and Morarji Desai and IK Gujral (1 each). Singh, on the other hand, went there 8 times as India's premier.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet President Joe Biden on Thursday during his first state visit to the U.S. High on the agenda will be deepening of defense ties, partnerships in technology and India's role in the Indo-Pacific. Ties between India and the U.S. are at a turning point and the relationship between the two nations have improved in the last decade, said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at Observer Research Foundation, a Delhi-based think tank. ""This is a very important visit, it is as much about India reaching out to the U.S., as it is about the U.S. reaching out to India,"" Pant said. Biden has only hosted two state visits during his presidency, the first with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in December 2022, and the second with South Korea's president Yoon Suk Yeol in April. ""This visit symbolizes the unwavering commitment to deepening ties and signifies the immense potential for both countries to collaborate amidst global challenges,"" Farwa Aamer the director of South Asia initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said. ""For many in India and the U.S., the visit is a testament to the promise and high expectations for the future of U.S.-India collaboration — one of shared prosperity,"" Aamer said. The U.S. is looking at India as a partner it can rely on, but its partnership will be very different since India is not an ally, Pant told CNBC. ""The U.S. is not used to having partners that are not allies, but is willing to look at its partnership with India differently — one that is relatively independent minded but will help American priorities as well,"" he said in a phone interview.

Strengthening defense ties

India and Russia have long shared a steadfast relationship, with India relying heavily on the Kremlin for oil and military weapons. The South Asian nation is the world's largest buyer of Russian arms, accounting for approximately 20% of Russia's current order, Reuters reported. ""India has been too dependent on one country and that is not good, and although dependence has dropped from 80% in the 1990s to about 65% now, dependence is still huge,"" Pant pointed out. However, because of the war in Ukraine, Russia has not been able to send critical defense weapons it had promised India, pushing the Indian military to look to others — such as the U.S. — for supplies.

Still, analysts are optimistic that the meeting between Biden and Modi could lead to more weapons agreements. India has long been interested in buying SeaGuardian drones from the U.S., but the hoped-for deal that could be worth between $2 billion to $3 billion has been long hampered by ""bureaucratic stumbling blocks,"" Reuters reported. The deal could still be brought back to the table. ""India's Ministry of Defense has reportedly approved the purchase so it seems likely. The U.S. would like this to go through,"" Manjari Miller, senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations told CNBC. ""It would be important for the partnership — only a few military allies and NATO countries have this drone, and the U.S. is particular about whom it sells U.S. weapons and technology to."" She highlighted that now is an important time for the deal to come through as it will draw ""India closer into the U.S. defense orbit, and is a step away from India's dependence on Russian arms and equipment."" India is undermining its strategic options by thinking it can continue to rely on Russia, Lisa Curtis, senior fellow and director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. ""It wants to try to keep a wedge between Russia and China because it doesn't want to contemplate the idea of Russia and China both arrayed against it. Then you throw Pakistan in there and things look really dire from the Indian perspective,"" Curtis told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The drones will also enhance the Indian armed forces ""intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance capabilities"" that will aid the country in securing their borders with China and Pakistan, Karthik Nachiappan, research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore said. Tensions between India and China over the disputed border in the Himalayan region has been ongoing since the 1950s with no end in sight. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in June 2020 in hand-to-hand combat with Chinese troops, followed by another clash in December 2022. But India wants to ""go beyond a buyer-seller relationship,"" with the U.S., Pant said adding that India is working toward a ""co-production and co-development relationship"" with the U.S. so it can build its own domestic manufacturing defense base. Private sectors in the U.S. could also start making more significant investments in India, with the two countries set to work together on producing fighter jet engines, said Pant. ""There's a change in the way the U.S. looks at India, and defense will be a beneficiary of that. India will definitely be looking to reduce its dependence on Russia, and that will be quite an extreme move,"" he added. Without mentioning China, the White House said in May the visit will ""strengthen our two countries' shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space."" ""Both the United States and India share the objective of not having an Asia that is dominated by China, or an Indo-Pacific region that is subject to Chinese coercion and assertiveness,"" said Ashley Tellis, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in a Q&A report.

Energy: Reliance on Russian oil

Although India's purchase of Russian weapons could fall, the same can't be said for oil. When Western nations imposed sanctions on Russian oil as a result of the unprovoked war in Ukraine, India doubled down on its purchases. Russian oil currently accounts for almost 20% of India's annual crude imports, a significant increase from just 2% in 2021, Reuters reported. Oil prices were extremely volatile at the start of the Ukraine war in February last year, spiking to $100 for the first time since 2014 . But India has continued to buy cheap Russian oil since and continues trading with the country despite global sanctions on the Kremlin.

""India has become very close to the West in the last five to 10 years, but it understands that it cannot simply detach from Russia,"" Amit Ranjan, research fellow at the NUS Institute of South Asian Studies said. ""Russia is an old friend of India, and India understands the importance of the relationship … Oil is an important piece of that relationship,"" Ranjan said.

Technology: Diversifying from China

Partnerships in technology will be also be top on the agenda for Modi. ""I think the technology issues have become so critically important, as we see China making advancements and hear about China's advancements with AI,"" according to Curtis. ""In seeing how much China is advancing, the U.S. now understands the importance of really cooperating closely with India and trying to take advantage of the strengths on both sides,"" she said. ""There are so many ways that the two sides can benefit from this increased technology cooperation—not to mention the progress that has been made on semiconductors. This has been a real area of focus for India and the United States, and I see that only growing as we move into the future,"" Curtis added. There will also be a flurry of business meetings with tech leaders. Tesla chief Elon Musk met Modi in New York to discuss the EV company's ambitions in India and the possibility of setting up a manufacturing facilities in the country. Modi is also expected to meet other CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft's Satya Nadella and FedEx's Raj Subramaniam at the White House state dinner on Thursday, sources told CNBC. The growing partnership between India and the U.S. also gives room for the two nations to adopt a ""China plus one"" strategy and push more technology companies to set up operations in India, analysts told CNBC. The U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology was announced in May last year. The iCET initiative aims to ""elevate and expand"" the two countries' technology partnership and defense industrial cooperation, the White House said in January. Pant said it points to the two countries' willingness to work together — both in terms of research and development, and what both governments can do together. In the last six months, more U.S. technology companies have set their eyes on India."

Modi, however, has undertaken several visits to US as India's PM. Here is a look back at his previous visits to the United States (as listed on the US State Department's website):

He went there in September 2021 as well; that trip, however, is not listed on the State Department's website.

Indian PMs in United States

As many as 9 Indian prime ministers, including Modi and his predecessor Singh, have undertaken official visits to the United States. While Singh went there 8 times, Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first PM, made as many as 4 visits, the same number as Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who preceded Singh in the office.

Others are Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi (3 each), PV Narasimha Rao (2), and Morarji Desai and IK Gujral (1 each).

Modi will become just the third world leader, after France’s Emmanuel Macron and South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol, to receive this kind of diplomatic reception from President Biden.

While Modi has visited the U.S. many times—most recently for a three-day visit in September 2021, where he held a bilateral meeting with Biden—this will be the first time the Prime Minister’s trip will be categorized as the highest ranked visit according to diplomatic protocol. (The last state visit to the U.S. by an Indian leader was by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in November 2009.)

As India takes center stage as the world’s most populous country, one of the fastest growing economies, and a powerhouse for tech and innovation, the Biden Administration hopes it can court the country as a crucial ally to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

“The visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space,” the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.

Below, what to know about the upcoming visit.

What are the top priorities for Modi’s state visit?

The state visit will include conversations aimed at further cementing an already-growing defense and manufacturing relationship between the U.S. and India. More recently, Washington and New Delhi have been engaged in discussions about jointly producing jet engines, long-range artillery, and military vehicles. In May, India joined Biden’s 14-member Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which primarily aims to reduce China’s economic dominance through manufacturing, but without drawing up a formal trade agreement. Now, American company General Electric is hoping to co-produce military jets in the country, while the U.S. has increased investment in a semiconductor and chip manufacturing ecosystem set in India as a way to decrease dependence on Chinese manufacturing.

“The United States has really oriented a lot of its domestic and foreign policy around this question of, ‘how do we counter the Chinese challenge?’” says Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at Carnegie. “So if you think about semiconductors and chip manufacturing, India is a big player right now.”

In the weeks leading up to Modi’s visit, both the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have also made trips to New Delhi in an attempt to cut through the red tape to secure deals.

This week, Reuters reported that India was inching closer to buying more than two dozen U.S.-made armed drones worth $2 to $3 billion to help enhance border surveillance and improve counterterrorism intelligence operations. The development comes after Sullivan, along with India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, unveiled an ambitious roadmap for Indo-U.S. collaboration in specific high-technology areas, including semiconductors, next-generation telecommunication, artificial intelligence and defense.

For India, striking deals with the U.S. will in turn strengthen the country’s hard power capabilities and make it a hotbed for innovation. “They are hoping to get more U.S. dollars, more U.S. companies, and more U.S. entrepreneurs to make India a central part of their growth and expansion plans,” says Vaishnav.

Why do the U.S. and India want to counter China?

Experts say both countries see their strategic interests converge in countering China’s threat as it becomes more expansionist and ambitious on the global stage. For the U.S., China has increasingly become its biggest competitor in the spheres of influence, while India has been embroiled in territorial disputes in the Himalayas ever since it fought a brief war with China in 1962.

In 2020, tensions between India and China flared when Beijing became more assertive over land claims along the shared Himalayan border and an altercation between Indian and Chinese military forces in the northern Indian region of Ladakh reportedly left 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead. China’s close ties to Pakistan has also resulted in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as part of the Belt and Road Initiative and controversially passes through a section of Kashmir controlled by Islamabad, adding to India’s concerns.

By helping India build up its economic and defense capabilities, Washington hopes to coordinate with New Delhi to tackle global challenges as part of its long-term interests, says Vaishnav. “Washington is really looking to create a framework of deterrence to essentially deter Chinese expansionism, and they view India as a linchpin in this strategy,” he says.

How has the relationship between India and the U.S. changed?

Relations between India and the U.S. have changed in notable ways over the years. After independence from British rule in 1947, India was more closely aligned with Russia during the Cold War era due to U.S. distrust and estrangement over India’s nuclear program, while the U.S. had a stronger partnership with India’s rival, Pakistan.

The two countries remained “estranged democracies,” according to the former U.S. Ambassador, Dennis Kux, until the early 1990s. However, since the early 2000s, U.S. administrations from Bill Clinton to Donald Trump have worked to build a strong relationship with India, recognizing its potential to be a strategic partner in ensuring the security of the Indo-Pacific region.

In 2005, India and the U.S. signed a major nuclear deal under which India was recognized de facto as a nuclear weapons power. More recently, India’s participation in the Quad, a security alliance between the U.S. and its allies, Australia, Japan and India, has led to the country becoming a critical element of American defense strategy.

Last year, the two countries conducted joint military exercises not far from the disputed Indo-China border, and in May, joined Biden’s 14-member Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which officials and business executives hope will reduce American reliance on Chinese manufacturing for mutual benefit, including increased iPhone shipments from Indian-based factories.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India will receive a lavish welcome on Thursday in Washington, where he will address a joint session of Congress and be feted by President Biden and the first lady in a state dinner at the White House — only the third state leader to be hosted by the current administration.

Swirling around the pageantry of a momentous visit for U.S.-India relations, seen as an affirmation of India’s rise as an economic and diplomatic power, will be weighty questions of geopolitical alignments with regard to China’s economic influence and Russia’s military aggression, as well as the erosion of India’s secular democracy under Mr. Modi. How much if any of that will be publicly addressed by the two leaders is unclear.

The visit is a significant diplomatic prize for Mr. Modi, who was once denied a visa to the United States for his role in religious riots in his home state, and as prime minister has increasingly consolidated power and edged his country closer to one-party rule."

It also encompasses interaction in the fields of economics and trade, energy and climate change, cyber-governance, counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, and defense issues, as well as health and immigration.

On September 23, The India Project at Brookings hosted an event to preview the Modi visit and release a new Brookings policy brief “The Modi-Obama Summit: A Leadership Moment for India and the United States,” which contains over two dozen memos that provide an overview of the most important opportunities in the bilateral relationship and recommendations for next steps both governments should take. The panel discussion included Tanvi Madan, fellow and director of The India Project; Joshua Meltzer, fellow with the Global Economy and Development program; and Neil Ruiz, senior policy analyst and associate fellow in the Metropolitan Policy program. William Antholis, managing director of Brookings, moderated the discussion.

I look forward to meeting the vibrant Indian-American community that represents the best of our societies. I will also meet some of the leading CEOs to discuss opportunities for elevating our trade and investment relationship and for building resilient global supply chains.

I am confident that my visit to the US will reinforce our ties based on shared values of democracy, diversity and freedom. Together we stand stronger in meeting the shared global challenges.

I will travel to Cairo from Washington D.C. at the invitation of President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. I am excited to pay a State Visit to a close and friendly country for the first time.

We had the pleasure of receiving President Sisi as the Chief Guest at our Republic Day celebrations this year. These two visits in the span of a few months is a reflection of our rapidly evolving partnership with Egypt, which was elevated to a ‘Strategic Partnership’ during President Sisi’s visit.

The Joe Biden’s administration rolled out its full pageantry for the Indian leader during the three-day visit. At a joint press conference with PM Modi, President Biden called this a new era in the US-India relationship. He exuded that the partnership is “stronger, closer and more dynamic than at any time in history” and that the economic relationship is “booming.”

The fact that trade between the two countries has more than doubled over the past decade underscores President Biden’s point. Despite all the pomp and pageantry of a state dinner and PM Modi’s address to the US Congress, it can be said that this visit wasn’t just about optics.

The two sides came to an agreement on a long list of deliverables spanning defence, critical and emerging technology, and space cooperation. The deals on defence and semiconductors in particular are aimed at countering China’s growing hegemony.

Let us take a look at all the deals and its impact on India’s status as an emerging power.

PM Modi’s US visit defence deals

General Electric (GE) has signed an agreement with India’s Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) to jointly manufacture engines, which will power fighter jets of the Indian Air Force. This historic deal is the most significant deliverable of PM Modi’s visit as the US is willing to give India access to cutting-edge jet engine technology, which it rarely shares. The GE engine in question is the F414, the workhorse for US Navy’s fighter jets.

The F414 engine will power India’s next-generation Tejas 2. India will also procure the deadly armed version of MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. These drones will significantly enhance India’s surveillance capabilities along the border with China in the Himalayan heights and in the Indian Ocean.

Boost to India’s domestic chip sector

India is looking to become a semiconductor powerhouse as US is encouraging American chipmakers to decrease their dependence on China. So, there were deals in this sphere as well.

US rchipmaker Micron Technology will invest more than $800 million towards a new $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and testing plant, to be built in Gujarat.

Applied Materials has announced that it will build a Semiconductor Centre for commercialisation and innovation in India in order to diversify its semiconductor supply chain.

PM Modi’s US visit: Big move on US visas

The Biden administration has announced that it will make it easier for skilled Indian workers to get and renew US visas. A pilot program to renew visas domestically for certain petition-based temporary workers will be introduced. This essentially means that applicants will not have to travel outside to get their renewal stamp. This program could be expanded to include H1B and L skilled visas by 2024.

India-US Space cooperation and Artemis Accords

India has joined the US-led Artemis Accords on space exploration. Also, India’s space agency ISRO will work with NASA towards a joint mission to the International Space Station in 2024.

Geopolitical messaging of PM Modi’s US visit

The US is trying to position India as a bulwark to China’s growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific. The Pentagon is also aiming to wean India off Russian arms. The deals that were signed during PM Modi’s US visit will enhance India’s role as a major player in the region and boost India's standing in the world."

WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is in talks with Indian officials over a possible White House visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this year, according to a U.S. official aware of the discussions and another person briefed on the matter.

U.S. President Joe Biden is eager to deepen ties with the world's largest democracy as part of his bid to win what he has framed as a contest between free and autocratic societies, especially China.

The White House and the Indian Embassy in Washington declined to comment.

Dates are not finalized, the sources said. Discussions about a possible White House visit intensified this week as Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met with his U.S. counterpart, Jake Sullivan, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington.

During the visit, the United States and India launched a partnership to deepen ties on military equipment, semiconductors and artificial intelligence.

New Delhi has frustrated Washington by participating in military exercises with Russia and increasing purchases of the country's crude oil, a key source of funding for the war in Ukraine. Washington has been pushing New Delhi to do more to punish Russia for the Ukraine invasion.

India proposed on Wednesday hiking military spending for the upcoming year by 13% to $72.6 billion as it seeks to add more fighter jets and roads along its tense border with China. India and China share a 2,100-mile (3,400-kilometer) frontier that has been disputed since the 1950s.

The U.S. president is expected to make his own trip to New Delhi in September for the G20 meetings hosted by India.

Biden is also expected to meet with Modi during a mid-year meeting of the Quad countries, which is hosted by Australia and also includes Japan.

Those countries, along with South Korea, are key to Biden's strategy of strengthening regional alliances and shoring up Asian security in the face of threats including China's claims of Taiwan and vast swathes of the South China Sea.

President George W. Bush's administration in 2005 denied Modi a U.S. visa after a 2002 incident where more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in sectarian riots in the Indian state of Gujarat, where he had been chief minister. Modi denied any wrongdoing.

He was first invited to the White House after he became prime minister in 2014 by Barack Obama.

Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a record-breaking victory in his home state Gujarat in December and is widely expected to win the next general election in 2024.

Thousands gathered on the White House South Lawn ahead of the formal welcoming ceremony, listening to performances by violinist Vibha Janakiraman and the a cappella group Penn Masala as they waited for Modi’s arrival.

But as Biden fetes Modi, human rights advocates and some U.S. lawmakers are questioning the Democratic president’s decision to offer the high honor to a leader whose nine-year tenure over the world’s biggest democracy has been marked by a backslide in political, religious and press freedoms.

Biden administration officials say honoring Modi, the leader of the conservative Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is Diplomacy 101. The U.S.-India relationship will be vital in coming decades as both sides navigate an ascendant China and enormous challenges posed by climate change, artificial intelligence, supply chain resilience and other issues.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden will raise his concerns but will avoid lecturing the prime minister during their formal talks.

“The question of where politics and the question of democratic institutions go in India is going to be determined within India by Indians. It’s not going to be determined by the United States,” Sullivan said. “So what we can do is our part, and our part is to speak out on behalf of universal values.”

Among the major announcements to be made Thursday is an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones, according to senior Biden administration officials. The officials briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to preview the major agreements ahead of their formal announcement.

The Biden administration also is unveiling plans aimed at bolstering India’s semiconductor industry. U.S.-based Micron Technology has agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending $800 million and India funding the rest. U.S.-based Applied Materials is announcing it will launch a new semiconductor center for commercialization and innovation in India, and Lam Research, another semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will start a training program for 60,000 Indian engineers.

On the space front, India will sign on to the the Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space exploration cooperation among nations participating in NASA’s lunar exploration plans. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station next year.

The State Department will also announce plans to open consulates in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad, while India will reopen its consulate in Seattle.

Despite the major deals, the visit will be shadowed by concerns laid out by rights activists and lawmakers that question Modi’s commitment to democratic principles.

Modi has faced criticism over legislation amending the country’s citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalization for some migrants but excludes Muslims, a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists, and the recent conviction of India’s top opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modi’s surname.

In 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi’s visa to the U.S., citing concerns that, as chief minister of Gujarat, he did not act to stop communal violence during 2002 anti-Muslim riots that left more than 1,000 people dead. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.

Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar on Minnesota have said they will boycott Modi’s address on Thursday before a joint meeting of Congress. And a group of more than 70 lawmakers wrote Biden this week calling on him to use his meeting with Modi to raise concerns about the erosion of religious, press and political freedoms.

“It is an important country to me, and we must call out some of the real issues that are threatening the viability of of democracy in all of our countries,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who was born in India and helped organize the lawmakers’ letter. “If India continues to backslide, I think it will affect our ability to have a really strong relationship with the country.”

Biden and Modi have also had differences over Russia’s war in Ukraine. India abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and refused to join the global coalition against Russia. Since the start of the war, the Modi government has also dramatically increased its purchase of Russian oil.

White House officials note that there are signs of change in India’s relationship with Russia, which has long been New Delhi’s biggest defense supplier.

India is moving away from Russian military equipment, looking more to the U.S., Israel, the United Kingdom and other nations. Modi recently met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and has spoken out about his worries about the potential use of nuclear weapons by Russia.

State visits typically are reserved for America’s closest allies, but they also have been used in the past as a carrot to try to strengthen relationships with countries with which the United States has had complicated relationships.

President Barack Obama honored Chinese Presidents Hu Jintao in 2011 and Xi Jinping in 2015.

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter hosted Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran, and his wife for a state visit. That visit came about 15 months before the shah was overthrown in Iran’s Islamic Revolution.

Violent clashes between pro- and anti-shah demonstrators broke out just south of the White House, leading police to deploy tear gas as an official ceremony was underway on the South Lawn. The stinging tear gas wafted to the welcoming ceremony.

Carter later apologized to the shah for the “air pollution.”

Modi’s busy itinerary on Thursday includes an Oval Office meeting with Biden, his address to Congress and a lavish White House state dinner hosted by Biden and first lady Jill Biden.

Modi, who hasn’t taken part in a formal press conference in years, has agreed to participate in one with Biden, according to the White House. Typically, state visits include a news conference in which the leaders take questions from two members of the U.S. press and two from the visiting press corps.

Modi is to be honored at a State Department luncheon on Friday hosted by Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He also is scheduled to address members of the Indian diaspora before departing Washington.

“President Biden is invested in making sure we get this partnership between these two countries, between these two peoples, right,” Sullivan said, adding that this could “deliver benefits to both of our peoples and to the world as a whole in the decades to come.”

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was once shunned by the United States. Denied a visa for “severe violations of religious freedom,” he was effectively banned from entering the country for nearly a decade.

But in the nine years since that ban was lifted, Modi has been progressively embraced by the White House – now more than ever.

The leader of the world’s most populous nation will meet with US President Joe Biden during a state visit to Washington this week, in a trip that is expected to further boost defense, trade and technology ties, and celebrate “the warm bonds of family and friendship” that link the two countries together.

Modi will also lead celebrations for the International Day of Yoga at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Wednesday, illustrating the influence of India’s soft power.

He will then address Congress the following day, an honor reserved for close US allies, and attend a lavish state dinner hosted by Biden in a clear indication of how much of a strategic partner Modi has become.

But while the ceremonies and diplomatic niceties play out in Washington, analysts say Modi’s visit will also be a test for the Biden administration, that has positioned itself as a democratic protector in an increasingly populist and polarized era, while seemingly turning a blind eye to New Delhi’s alleged human rights abuses playing out at home.

Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has come under scrutiny from rights groups and opposition lawmakers for its increasingly strident brand of Hindu nationalist politics and an ongoing crackdown on dissent. Pressure is growing for Biden, who views India as a critical regional partner, to address those concerns in some way during Modi’s visit.

But analysts say criticism is unlikely given India’s growing leverage in the Indo-Pacfic, as well as its 5 million strong diaspora in the US – among the country’s largest immigrant groups and its fastest growing voting bloc.

Daniel S. Markey, senior adviser, South Asia, for the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), said Washington sees India as “a strategic swing state in a world order increasingly defined by competition between the US and China,” adding that human rights concerns have “generally taken a back seat” to geopolitics.

“But I believe they are still relevant, or should be,” Markey said. “If only because India’s deteriorating democracy will on balance make it a more challenging and less effective US partner.”

“The visit is a test because Biden should not look to be embracing Modi’s authoritarian policies,” he added.

“The goal for the White House, in my view, should be to embrace relations with India without personalizing the relationship or endorsing Modi’s politics. That is a tough needle to thread.”

A challenge for Washington

Modi’s US trip is the latest in a slew of diplomatic engagements he has undertaken in recent weeks, and Washington is not the only Western nation to have rolled out the red carpet.

Last month, he met Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Sydney, who eulogized Modi as a rockstar, called the leader a “boss” and spoke of how he had strengthened Australia’s democracy.

Before that, Modi was in Papua New Guinea, where he met with Prime Minister James Marape and pledged his support for the Pacific Islands, a region that China has also increased outreach to.

Days earlier, he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Japan – the first time they had come face-to-face since Russia’s invasion began.

Markey said this is symbolic of how Modi has prioritized “winning accolades from other democratic leaders in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.”

Such engagements “serve Modi’s political purposes in India,” he added.

“His supporters are encouraged by the respect he wins on the world stage, while his critics are demoralized because their concerns aren’t taken seriously in other democracies,” Markey said.

Last week, Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged the White House to put rights concerns at “the center” of the Modi-Biden summit.

“Modi and Biden should jointly acknowledge human rights challenges – both in India and the US – and agree to address them,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for the group, in a statement.

HRW and Amnesty International have invited policymakers to a screening of the BBC documentary that questioned Modi’s leadership during deadly sectarian riots in 2002 in Gujarat, when he was chief minister of the western Indian state.

The documentary was banned in India and the BBC’s offices in New Delhi were raided by tax authorities soon after it aired sparking outrage among rights groups.

Washington’s comparative silence on criticism of Modi does not go unnoticed within India among government critics and those uncomfortable with BJP rule.

“What irks a lot of people in India is the dishonesty towards Indian democratic norms, religious freedom, and of freedom of press,” said Sushant Singh, a senior fellow with one of India’s leading think tanks, Centre for Policy Research.

“The fact that the White House goes out of its way to call India ‘mother of democracy’… does irk people in India because they believe that the United States has been dishonest.”

A careful maneuver

In Washington this week, Modi and Biden are expected to announce a number of trade and defense deals.

The visit, according to Tanvi Madan, a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, is “significant” and “can’t be seen in isolation.”

It builds on “almost two and a half decades of progress in the relationship,” she said. “There are moments of opportunity that open that have the potential to move relationships to a higher level, and this is one of them.”

Shared concerns over China is a key priority.

India and China have been engaged in a military standoff along their shared Himalayan border that has claimed dozens of lives over the last three years, and both New Delhi and Washington are becoming increasingly uneasy over Beijing’s growing military might, its aggressive territorial claims on land and at sea, and its growing economic influence over its smaller neighbors.

But as India grows closer to the US, it still remains heavily dependent on Russia for its military equipment. That has been a key source of frustration for Western powers.

Rather than cutting economic ties with the Kremlin, India has undermined Western sanctions by ramping up purchases of Russian oil, coal and fertilizer – giving President Vladimir Putin a vital financial lifeline as his forces wage a brutal war against Ukraine that has reverberated across the globe.

New Delhi has also repeatedly abstained from votes condemning Russia at the United Nations – providing Moscow with a veneer of international legitimacy.

This careful maneuvering exemplifies India’s unique position on the war: verbally distancing itself from Russia, while continuing to maintain pivotal relations with Moscow and deepening its ties with the West.

And the West, according to Madan, is willing to go easy on New Delhi because of its growing clout.

“The US has seen India as important in its own right – as a large, economically growing democracy, with military and technological capabilities that will play a key role in the international order,” she said, adding it is also a vital “geopolitical counterbalance, economic alternative, and democratic contrast to China.”

In recent months, signs of problems have also emerged between New Delhi and Moscow. In March, the Indian Air Force said Russia was unable to honor its arms delivery commitments to India because of the war in Ukraine.

On Monday, India’s Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra called New Delhi’s defense relationship with Washington “robust and dynamic.”

Speaking to reporters, he said the defense roadmap that India and the US have been discussing “focuses on all aspects of defense, core production and core development,” and could be a “key aspect” of Modi’s trip.

Meanwhile, Biden’s government is looking to encourage manufacturers to reduce its reliance on China, and pivot towards India, which has 1.4 billion people – many of whom are young, educated and largely English-speaking.

“Modi is being welcomed in various countries because India is seen as an attractive – and useful – partner by many countries because of its growing global and regional role,” Madan said.

“I don’t expect public condemnation from the White House,” she added. “The focus will be a celebration of India and the India-US partnership.”"

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

The White House will roll out the red carpet this week for a crucial Asian ally. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet President Biden on Thursday, with a lavish state dinner also on the schedule. That same day, Modi will address a joint session of Congress. The Biden administration has made deepening ties with India a top foreign policy priority as it hopes to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Seema Sirohi is a columnist for The Economic Times, one of India's most influential newspapers, and author of the book ""Friends With Benefits: The India-U.S. Story."" She joins us now to discuss the trip. Welcome.

SEEMA SIROHI: Nice to be with you.

RASCOE: The White House is pulling out all the stops for Prime Minister Modi. Why is this relationship so important to the U.S.?

SIROHI: Well, the U.S. has identified China as a competitor, as a rival. So India has become very important for U.S.'s Indo-Pacific policy because the U.S. wants to retain its No. 1 position in the region. India, which has China on its border, is in a very sort of border standoff situation for the past two years. So the interests of both India and the United States have converged on countering China, to put it very simply. And then there are many, many other reasons why the U.S. thinks of India as a major partner. India needs the U.S. for its own development. The U.S. needs the talent from India. As you might know, there are almost 200,000 Indian students in the United States, and Indian Americans are increasingly very, very important, both politically as well as in the economic arena.

RASCOE: And so what will Prime Minister Modi want from President Biden during this visit? Like, what are his priorities?

SIROHI: So for India, technology transfer is a top priority. Becoming part of the supply chains is another very big priority. Both countries trust each other, and they are building what they call resilient supply chains so that the world will not be dependent on just one factory that is China. There is a deal that might be signed for one of the major U.S. companies to invest in trying to create a semiconductor ecosystem in India. Another big deal that is likely to be announced is for the U.S. General Electric to co-produce its military jet engines in India. And that's a huge step forward 'cause India has long wanted technology transfer. In the past things have stalled because the U.S. hasn't been so amenable to that.

RASCOE: And so, I mean, you've been covering this relationship for decades, so how has it changed over the years?

SIROHI: What I can tell you is when I first came to Washington, India was not an important partner for the United States. Everything was about China and Pakistan, both of which are rivals of India. Then President George W. Bush changed dramatically the U.S. policy towards India because Bush's idea was why aren't the two democracies better friends? So India and the U.S. signed a major nuclear deal under which India was recognized de facto as a nuclear weapons power. Now people are comparing that transformative moment to today.

RASCOE: Prime Minister Modi has been accused of eroding Indian democracy and suppressing criticism of his ruling party. Do you think any of that will be raised this week?

SIROHI: It won't be raised in public, I would say - not by the administration, not at the White House. But you might see some comments from congressmen and senators on Capitol Hill. But right now, realism in terms of geopolitics tops human rights concerns, to put it very bluntly. Countering China is very important for the United States at this moment, and getting as many allies and partners in line on the American side is the main goal.

RASCOE: That's Seema Sirohi, a newspaper columnist and author of ""Friends With Benefits: The India-U.S. Story."" Thank you so much for being with us.

SIROHI: Thank you.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi left for the United States on June 20 for his first state visit to the country.

His visit from June 21 to 23 will take him to New York, where he will participate in World Yoga Day, and to Washington for his engagement with President Joe Biden and others in his administration.

Modi has been to the US a number of times since 2014, but his first state visit is an opportunity to further solidify the growing relationship between the two countries.

The visit has generated a significant amount of interest and curiosity in diplomatic circles in New Delhi and beyond, as well as scepticism.

The sceptics contend the Biden administration is pulling out all the stops for Modi to bring India into a tighter American strategic embrace and curtail India’s strategic sovereignty.

However, the mood in both capitals is upbeat, and the visit is being seen as a landmark in the Indo-US partnership.

From Washington, Modi will travel to Egypt for another state visit.

US President Joe Biden is laying out the red carpet to welcome Modi with a private dinner and a state banquet.

Modi has been invited to address the joint session of the US Congress, an honour that was given to him in 2014 too, making him the only Indian leader to do so twice.

Since the invitation came from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, it indicates bilateral support in the US for strengthening ties with India.

Vice President Kamala Harris and US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken are also organising a lunch for him. Modi will also have curated engagements with American CEOs. The PM will attend a reception by the Indian diaspora too.

Sceptics say a free meal or a televised speech to Congress costs the US nothing.

They argue the ploy is to bring India into a tight American strategic embrace as a junior partner.

Indian officials point out that the visit is not only about pomp and show but also has a substantive part to reflect the steady growth in bilateral ties.

The US is India’s largest trade partner, and bilateral trade is over $191 billion. India has also bought over $20 billion of weapons from the US since 2008 and spent another $3 billion recently to acquire sophisticated US drones.

A number of agreements are likely to be signed during the Prime Minister’s visit, and there is likely to be a transfer of US technology for joint production of fighter jets in India.

The two sides may also formalise the iCet agreement—the US-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies—that can give India access to the areas of AI, quantum computing, 5G/6G telecommunication, biotech, space, and semiconductors.

The China angle

Modi’s visit takes place at a time when China’s growing assertion in the Indo-Pacific has raised serious concerns in the region.

India has also been engaged in a military face-off with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) since May 2020.

Both India and the US have a convergence on the challenge China poses in the Indo-Pacific.

The US fears there can be a war over Taiwan with China, and in recent months has been strengthening its military alliance.

But despite its concern vis-à-vis China, India has refused to join any military alliance.

India has also refused to condemn the ongoing Ukraine war.

Russia is India’s close strategic partner and chief supplier of weapons.

India also values Russia as a counterweight to China and feels the two countries are not natural allies but have been forced together because of US policy.

Though the Biden administration seems to have come to terms with the Indian stand on Russia, there are many American experts who refuse to see the Indian logic.

Some of them have also described India as a ""fence-sitter,"" as it has refused to join the US-led military alliance against China.

Both issues are likely to come up during Modi’s interaction with the American leadership.

Former Indian ambassador to the US, Arun K Singh, argues that convergence in the Indo-US partnership should also allow space for occasional disagreements between the two sides.

Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra told newsmen on Monday that bilateral, regional, and global issues are likely to come up for discussion between Modi and Biden.

Indian experts point out that the US and India have different concepts of partnership.

The US essentially sees it as a military alliance, while India is inclined to have multiple partnerships, even with countries that have adversarial relations with each other, if it serves legitimate Indian national interests.

But the Indian establishment is a little worried about access to cutting-edge US technology that has been promised by senior Biden administration members.

Much of the effort has not produced the desired results because of the ""maze of stringent legislative and administrative hurdles"" in the US system.

However, this has not dampened the optimism of the two sides that Modi’s first state visit to the US will be able to elevate bilateral relations to a new high."
41,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-indian-prime-minister-modi-state-visit/story?id=100277881,Biden welcomes Indian Prime Minister Modi for state visit,,"President Joe Biden rolled out the red carpet Thursday for Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India for the third state visit of his presidency.

The visit will put on full display the ""deep and close partnership"" between the U.S. and India, the White House said, despite concerns India's democratic principles have eroded under Modi's leadership.

The relationship has been described by Biden as ""one of the most important"" of this century as the U.S. rebalances its foreign policy focus to the Indo-Pacific in the face of an increasingly aggressive China. Just ahead of Modi's visit, President Biden suggested Chinese President Xi Jinping was a ""dictator.""

""There's a strategic imperative in the region,"" Tanvi Madan, the director of The India Project at the Brookings Institution, told ABC News. ""Multiple administrations have seen India as a geopolitical counterbalance, an economic alternative and a democratic contrast to China.""

The two leaders greeted each other warmly on the South Lawn in a welcome featuring marching bands and honor guards, despite rainy weather. Vice President Kamala Harris, the first person of Indian descent in her role, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were also there to greet the prime minister.

""The challenges and opportunities facing the world in this century require that India and the United States work and lead together, and we are,"" Biden said.

Modi said the partnership between the U.S. and India ""will be instrumental in enhancing the strength of the whole world.""

Biden and Modi met in the Oval Office and appeared side by side at a brief news conference in the East Room, a rarity for Modi who only held his first-ever press conference in India in 2019 after being in power for five years.

Modi also appeared on Capitol Hill to address a joint meeting of Congress before a state dinner at the White House Thursday night.

The prime minister received a standing ovation as he entered the chamber to chants of ""Modi, Modi"" from members, though a handful of progressive Democrats boycotted the speech, citing reports of human rights abuses.

Modi took a moment to note those in the chamber who have Indian roots, turning to point to Vice President Harris seated behind him whom he celebrated as having ""made history.""

""We come from different circumstances and history, but we are united by a common vision. And, by a common destiny,"" Modi told lawmakers in closing. ""When our partnership progresses, economic resilience increases, innovation grows, science flourishes, knowledge advances, humanity benefits, our seas and skies are safer, democracy will shine brighter and the world will be a better place.""

About 400 guests are expected to attend the dinner, the White House said, which will include a plant-based menu and a mixture of American and Indian decor. There will be performances from American violinist Joshua Bell and from Penn Masala, a South Asian a cappella group from the University of Pennsylvania.

Modi's trip to Washington, though, isn't without controversy as the prime minister's been criticized for a rise in violence against religious minorities as well as a crackdown on the press and dissenters.

Some democracy watchdogs have downgraded India's rating in recent years. The U.S.-based Freedom House rated India as ""partly free"" in its 2023 report, and the Sweden-based Varieties of Democracy called India an ""electoral autocracy.""

""He's got a mixed record,"" Richard Rossow, chair U.S.-India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said of Modi. ""We do see at times he feels politically weak domestically, he's initiated steps that directly or indirectly seem to stoke the fears of religious intolerance by him and his party. And we've also seen crackdown on civil society to some extent.""

Human rights advocates and at least 70 lawmakers called on Biden to directly address human rights violations during Modi's visit. Experts told ABC News any human rights or democratic issues will likely be taken up in private between the two leaders.

Biden was asked during the news conference about those who've criticized his administration as overlooking such human rights concerns in hosting Modi.

""Look, the prime minister and I had a good discussion about democratic values,"" Biden responded. That's the nature of our relationship, we're straightforward with each other and we respect each other.""

""I believe that we believe in the dignity of every citizen and it is in America's and I believe in India's DNA that the whole world, the whole world has a stake in our success,"" the president continued. ""Both of us, in maintaining our democracies, make us appealing partners and enables us to expand democratic institutions across, around the world.""

Modi, meanwhile, sidestepped a question on recent allegations of human right abuses as he claimed in India ""there's absolutely no discrimination, neither on basis of cast, creed, or age, or any kind of geographic location.""

""I'm actually really surprised that people say so,"" the prime minister said as he defended his government. ""Indeed, India is a democracy ... democracy is in our DNA. democracy is our spirit. democracy runs in our veins. We live democracy.""

Also at issue during the trip was Russia. India, which has long relied on Russian oil and weapons, has avoided outrightly condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

But experts noted Modi's slight change in tone when it comes to Russia's invasion, such as his recent statements on the importance of territorial integrity and sovereignty.

""Both Washington and New Delhi understand that they will not necessarily see eye to eye on Russia,"" Kenneth Juster, who served as the U.S. ambassador to India during the Trump administration, told ABC News. ""But they can discuss that issue candidly with each other, and it is not going to have a negative impact on their broader strategic partnership.""

A senior Biden official said the White House would ""engage actively"" with India on issues related to Russia and Ukraine, specifically India's efforts to diversify away from Russian military equipment.

Talks between Biden and Modi also included trade, climate and space.

The two leaders announced a number of new commitments, including a joint space mission as well as various investments in technology, defense and clean energy.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking to the U.S.-India Business Council last week, touted trade between the two nations reached a record $191 billion. Blinken noted the U.S. is India's largest trading partner, and Indian companies invested more than $40 billion in the U.S. in IT, pharmaceuticals and more.

Though Juster said be believed there is still more work to do to advance on the trade front ahead of the state visit.

""For the world's largest economy, the United States, and its fifth largest economy, India, I believe that their bilateral trade relationship does not fulfill all of its potential. I am hoping that the two countries can continue to advance their trade and investment relationship both bilaterally and regionally, because economic issues are so important in the Indo-Pacific and China has a robust economic strategy for the region,"" he said.

Prior to landing in Washington, Modi met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk as well as other business leaders and health care experts.

He also marked International Day of Yoga by participating in a group session on the lawn of the United Nations headquarters.

The last time Modi visited the U.S. was in 2019, when he appeared alongside former President Donald Trump at a ""Howdy Modi"" rally in Texas attended by tens of thousands of people.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States has been fruitful in making India sign a number of pacts with the United States. The future of technologies like OpenRAN wireless systems, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and high performance is going to be shaped by the visit of the PM to the United States, as rightly said by Rajeev Chandrashekhar, the minister of state for electronics and information technology.

The Prime Minister of India reached New York on June 20th. On June 21, the International Yoga Day function was led by PM Modi at the United Nations Secretariat. PM Modi then flew to Washington on June 22 for the Bilateral and state dinner. On June 23 the highlight was the lunch at the US state department. The diaspora event held at the Ronald Reagan Centre in Washington was the last important event marked by PM Modi during his visit to the United States.

These are the visit to foreign countries which are liked by a head of government, acting in a sovereign capacity. These visits are officially described as “Visit of [name of the state]” and not “Visit of [name of leader]”. A state visit to the United States can only be possible when the president of the United States, acting in the capacity of the head of the state, formally invites the other state.

Leaving for USA, where I will attend programmes in New York City and Washington DC. These programmes include Yoga Day celebrations at the @UN HQ, talks with @POTUS @JoeBiden , address to the Joint Session of the US Congress and more. https://t.co/gRlFeZKNXR — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 20, 2023

The Joint Statement asserted that “no corner of human enterprise is untouched by the partnership between our two great countries, which spans the seas to the stars”.

The Joint Statement issued by both India and the United States has asserted a vision of the two nations as “among the closest partners in the world- a partnership of democracies looking into the 21st century with hope, ambition, and confidence.”

The visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stressed a “next-generation partnership” between the two countries, India and the United States, with confidence, ambition, and hope. Here are the agreements signed and concerns raised between the two countries, as part of the India- U.S. Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership.

1. Defense

There have been several initiatives undertaken by the two countries in the area of defense partnership. These are:

Memorandum of understanding between GE Aerospace and HAL

A memorandum of understanding has been signed between GE Aerospace and HAL for the production of fighter jet engines for Light Combat Aircraft. The agreement contained the potential joint production of F4141 engines of GE Aerospace in India. The involvement of GE in the Light Combat Aircraft program and its collaboration on the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft were emphasized.

Repair and service of US Navy ships

The United States Navy has concluded with Larsen and Toubro Shipyard in Kattupalli (Chennia) a Master Ship Repair Agreement (MSRA) and is also concluding agreements with the Mazagon Dock Limited in Mumbai and the Goa Shipyard. These agreements will enable US Navy ships to undergo repair and service at Indian shipyards, in between their voyage.

General Atomics MQ-9Bs

India aims at procuring armed MQ-9B Sea Guardian UAVs. These drones will be enhancing India’s surveillance, intelligence, as well as reconnaissance abilities.

The INDUS-X and Defense Acceleration Ecosystem

The India-United States Defence Acceleration Ecosystem INDUS-X, was launched with an aim to encourage collaboration between tech companies and start-ups of India and the United States. Technologies from 10 United States start-ups and 15 Indian start-ups in areas such as AI, maritime, space, and autonomous systems were showcased at the system.

Collaboration opportunities in the area of deep-tech innovations, especially in the AI domains were stressed upon.

2. Citizen-centric efforts

A myriad of efforts that have a direct impact on the people has also been discussed and agreed upon by the two countries.

Visa Renewal Program and Consulate Openings

A program for domestic visa renewal for some petition-based temporary workers was set forth. The aim of the program is to organize the visa process and also potentially incorporate skilled visas such as the L visas and H1b. Two fresh United States consulates in Ahmedabad and Bengaluru were planned. India will be reopening its consulates in Seattle and declaring new consulates elsewhere.

Energy Collaboration

India and the United States are going to continue to work jointly to hit their national energy and climate goals. India’s decision to co-lead the Hydrogen Breakthrough Agenda was also welcomed by the United States.

3. Technology

The two countries realize the importance of technological advancements and thus a series of agreements have been signed in this direction.

Deliverables and Investments

The visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has led to a wide array of deliverables across health, mobility, defense, mobility, and critical and emerging technology. The two leaders affirmed that technology is going to play a key role in strengthening the partnership. The inauguration of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) in January 2023 is seen as an important milestone between the two countries. The US-India Commercial Dialogue will be launching a new “Innovation Handshake” to connect the startup ecosystem of India and the United States, with the purpose to support the US-India Initiatives on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET).

Micron Technology, Inc.

Micron Technology Inc. is all set to make investments in a test facility and new chip assembly in the state of Gujarat, supported by the Gujarat government and the Central Government.

Critical Minerals Partnership

India has successfully become a partner of the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) led by the United States which has been set to boost the development of diverse and sustainable critical energy minerals supply chains all over the globe.

4. Space Co-operations between the two countries

State cooperation between the two countries was also fostered when India joined a framework for the purpose of space exploration and assented to a mission to International Space Station in the year 2024. As per the website of the Ministry of External Affairs of India, the United States appreciated India’s growing cooperation in areas of space technologies and space science. The decision of NASA and ISRO to design a strategic framework by the end of the year 2023, for human spaceflight cooperation. The announcement by NASA to offer advanced training to Indian astronauts with the aim of fostering a joint effort to the International Space Station in the year 2024 was also hailed. The NASA-ISRO SYntehtic Aperture Radar’s delivery to ISRO’s U.R. Rao Satellite Centre in Bengaluru, India was also celebrated by the two countries.

5. Concerns, shared values, and more

Many concerns were raised in relation to PM Modi’s tenure as a Chief Minister of Gujarat, along with issues of democratic backsliding in the country. Around 70 lawmakers wrote to the United States President, in order to urge him to address human rights and democratic norms during the discussions with the Indian Prime Minister.

Additionally, US former President Barack Obama appealed to Prime Minister Modi to safeguard the ethnic minorities in India. Both leaders emphasized the importance of diversity, equity, power of example, and democracy.

6. Strategic Trade Dialogue

U.S. President Biden and Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi committed to encouraging policies and incorporating regulations that help facilitate better technology sharing, co-production, and co-development opportunities between the industries of both countries. The launch of the Strategic Trade Dialogue in the month of June 2023, which pushed both sides to take regular attempts to address export controls, and explore methods of fostering high-technology commerce was also welcomed by the leaders.

In Conclusion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States was a fruitful one, with the two countries signing a number of agreements in the areas of defense, citizen-centric efforts, technology, and space cooperation. The visit also highlighted the importance of shared values, such as diversity, equity, and democracy.

This will be PM Modi's first state visit to the US during his nine-year reign as prime minister.

The last state visit to the US was made by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh between November 23 and 25, 2009.

Ahead of his visit, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday said that the trajectory of the India-US partnership is unthinkable and filled with promise.

Blinken addressed the US-India Business Council's India Ideas Summit in Washington DC. The annual USIBC summit is part of the US Chambers of Commerce and is being conducted ahead of the upcoming state visit of PM Modi.

""We know that India and the United States are big, complicated countries. We certainly have work to do to advance transparency, to promote market access, to strengthen our democracies, to unleash the full potential of our people. But, the trajectory of this partnership is unmistakable and it is filled with promise,"" Blinken said.

At the same event, India's ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, said that the speed and scale of the transformation of the India-US relationship have been ""phenomenal."" He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the third Indian leader to be accorded the honour of a state visit by the US President.

My Prime Minister is only the third Indian leader, in our independent history, to be accorded the honour of a state visit by the US President. He also becomes the only Indian leader to address the US Congress twice.""

While PM Modi has visited the US several times, it is the first time his trip has been called a state visit. But what are these state visits?

What are state visits?

State visits are visits of a head of state/ government to a foreign country in their official capacity. These visits are officially described as a ""visit of [name of state]"" rather than a ""visit of [name of leader]"". State visits to the US happen only at the invitation of the president of the United States, acting in their capacity as the head of state.

In the US, these visits have elaborate ceremonies like a flight line ceremony, a 21-gun salute White House arrival ceremony, a White House dinner, and an exchange of diplomatic gifts, among other things.

PM Modi will have a state dinner on June 22.

Moreover, these visits are the highest-ranked category of foreign visits and are considered a sign of friendly bilateral relations. To maintain their prestige, these events are relatively rarer. For example, the US President can host one leader from a nation only once every four years.

According to the level of importance, state visits are followed by official visits, official working visits, working visits, guest-of-government visits, and private visits, in that order.

How is a state visit different from an official visit?

In a state visit, only a head of a state (head of government in case of parliamentary democracies) can visit the foreign country. On official visits, any other leader like the president, vice-president or ceremonial heads can visit the foreign nation.

The protocols that need to be followed by a host nation are also different in these two visits.

Moreover, state visits are highly elaborate and include bigger ceremonies than official ones."
45,https://www.state.gov/briefings-foreign-press-centers/preview-of-minister-modi-visit/,Preview of the Upcoming State Visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Republic of India and News of the Day,,"THE WASHINGTON FOREIGN PRESS CENTER, WASHINGTON, D.C.

MODERATOR: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Washington Foreign Press Center. My name is Zina Wolfington and thank you all for coming today.

Today’s briefing is a preview of the upcoming state visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Republic of India and news of the day. As a reminder, the briefing is on the record, and we will post a transcript later today at fpc.state.gov.

I’m pleased to introduce John Kirby, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications. He will start with opening remarks, and then open for questions.

Over to you, John.

MR KIRBY: Thank you. How are you doing today? Everybody okay?

QUESTION: Great.

MR KIRBY: All right. Okay. So just give me a few minutes here at the top, if you will.

As you all know, this is a big week here at the White House, as the President and First Lady welcome the prime minister of India for an official state visit and dinner. It’s only the third such state dinner and visit of this administration.

This visit will affirm the deep and close partnership between the United States and India and the warm bonds of family and friendship that link Americans and Indians together. The visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space.

The leaders will discuss ways to further expand our educational exchanges and people-to-people ties, as well as our work together to confront common challenges, from climate change to workforce development and health security. As the world’s oldest and largest democracies and as key net security providers in the Indo-Pacific, the United States and India are increasingly partners of first resort as a combined force for global good.

India will be a critical strategic partner for the United States in the coming decades. India’s growing commitment to playing a more engaged international role, including in the Indo-Pacific Quad, demonstrates a new and growing willingness to join the United States to protect and advance a shared vision of a free, open, and rules-based global order.

As we think about the future of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and building resilient supply chains for clean energy technologies, semiconductors, and other critical and emerging technology, countering climate change, the future of our workforces, and global health, energy, food security, there is no partner more consequential than India.

Now, we’re hosting India for an official state visit to put our cooperation on an inexorable trajectory, as we support India’s emergence as a great power that will be central to ensuring U.S. interest in the coming decades. After years of strengthening our ties, the United States-India partnership is deeper and more expansive than it has ever been in the past. We now look instinctively to each other and work cooperatively with each other to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific, to drive innovation, jointly tackle global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Together and working with other likeminded partners, our countries will shape the future, working towards a world that, again, is open and more prosperous, more stable, more secure, and, quite frankly, more resilient.

Now I’ll take some questions. Let’s see. Who’s in the front here? Go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you, John. I wanted to touch a little bit if you could in the – how much Ukraine is going to be —

MODERATOR: (Off-mike.)

QUESTION: Oh, of course. Sorry. I’m Beatriz. I’m with EFE News Agency in Spanish. I wanted to ask about Ukraine. Ukraine has been proposing for months now the – they have been proposing a peace summit and they have expressed interest in having India as a participant in this global peace summit. So I was wondering if this will be part of the conversation between the President and Prime Minister Modi. And what is the stance of the United States regarding this summit, if this summit should take place, and if it should include Russia? Thank you.

MR KIRBY: So just to lay flat where we are on a peace summit, look, we all want to see this war end. We’d like to see it end today. And as I’ve said many times, it could end today if Mr. Putin would do the right thing and pull his troops out. Now, obviously, he’s not going to do that, and he’s doubling down, and there’s some pretty vicious fighting going on right now in the east and in the south of Ukraine.

We have said many times that we support President Zelenskyy’s vision of a just peace, and we’ve said many times that any discussion – any credible discussion, whether it’s at a summit or somewhere else or in smaller settings, any discussion – would be welcome only if it’s going to be credible and sustainable, which means that it has to start with a foundation of a belief in Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity and start – at least start – with a discussion of the 10-point proposal that President Zelenskyy has put forward. You’ve heard President Biden say a million times “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” That exists today.

Now, as for the role of other nations, we have also long said we would welcome the role of a third-party country involved in a peace process, and we believe that there could be such a role for a third-party country in the peace process. But again, in order for that role to be sustainable and to have any chance at success, it’s got to start with a complete understanding of the Ukrainian perspective here and a complete and commit – a complete and utter commitment to the UN Charter, to the idea of territorial integrity, to Ukraine’s sovereignty along its internationally recognized borders.

And then whether it’ll be discussed: There’s no doubt in my mind that the war in Ukraine will come up this week in the – during the state visit with Prime Minister Modi. No question about it. Now, to what degree specifically they’ll talk about a peace summit or a peace proposal, I can’t say right now. We’ll have to wait to hear from the leaders after it. But there’s no doubt in my mind that they will have a chance to talk about what’s going on in Ukraine.

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Thank you, John, for doing this. This is a very significant visit and you – we all are waiting for this visit, obviously. Do you think regional – oh, my name is Mushfiqul. I am representing Just News media and the South Asia perspectives. Do you think regional democratic stability and human rights situation will be discussed during the upcoming visit of the Indian prime minister as democracy and human rights are the key elements of the Biden-Harris administration’s foreign policy?

And quick on Bangladesh, United States already announced the visa policy to support free, fair, and inclusive election in Bangladesh. Do you think, as the largest democracy in the world, India will be with the United States effort to ensuring voting rights and restoring democracy in Bangladesh, as Bangladesh experienced two farcical election in 2014 and 2018 and we observe the Indian influence to keep Sheikh Hasina in power?

MR KIRBY: So on your first question, it is commonplace and consistent for President Biden to raise concerns over human rights wherever he goes around the world and whatever leaders he’s speaking to. Human rights are a foundational element of this administration’s foreign policy, and you can certainly expect that the President will – as he always does and as you can do with friends and partners like Prime Minister Modi in India – raise our concerns about that.

On Bangladesh, again, I think we’d let the Indian Government speak for its bilateral relations with Bangladesh. But you are correct: We have already made clear our desire to free and fair elections in Bangladesh, and you’re right, we adapted our visa policy to restrict travel to individuals who undermine Bangladeshi elections. So I can only speak for ourselves. You know where we are. We’ve been pretty public about that, but we would let the Indian Government talk about their bilateral relations.

Yes, ma’am.

QUESTION: So this is Ayushi Agarwal from ANI, Asia News International, New Delhi, India. I have two questions. My first question is regarding China. So China has blocked a proposal by India and U.S. at the United Nations to designate Lashkar-e Tayyiba terrorist Sajad Mir, wanted for his involvement in the 26/11 terrorist attacks as a global terrorist. Your reaction on that, please, since we know that Beijing has earlier repeatedly put hold on such listings.

My second question is since the prime minister is reaching Washington tomorrow, if you can elaborate more on the defense relationship between India and the U.S. How robust is it? And what areas of defense cooperation could we see some tangible outcomes during the prime minister’s visit? Because we know there are some defense deals on the agenda.

Thank you.

MR KIRBY: So on your first question, I think I’d just – our belief in that designation I think speaks for itself, and I’d leave it there.

On your second question, you’re right, there is a very robust defense cooperation between the United States and India, and we are working and will continue to work to see if we can improve and deepen that defense cooperation. You will see – again, I don’t want to get ahead of the two leaders – but the issue of defense cooperation and deepening that, bolstering it, strengthening it, expanding it into areas like cyber and space and emerging technologies, all of that will be on the agenda here with the state visit. And again, I think you’ll hear more from the leaders afterward.

India is a sovereign nation, of course, and they get to make their own decisions about the partnerships that they explore and the cooperation that they enjoy with other countries. We’re very comfortable that under this administration and with President Biden’s leadership, we have really worked hard to advance the level of defense cooperation between our two countries. Because, as I said – I don’t know, probably may have mentioned it seven times in my opening statement – because with the Indians we certainly jointly believe in a safe and secure, prosperous, and open Indo-Pacific region, and Prime Minister Modi and the – and India are key players in trying to achieve that vision. So it only makes sense that we would look for ways to improve our defense cooperation. And again, I think you’ll see more coming out of this week and as the leaders have a chance to summarize what they discussed.

Yes, ma’am. Yeah.

QUESTION: Thank you, Admiral Kirby. Bingru Wang with Honk Kong Phoenix TV. Is one of the main purpose to invite Prime Minister Modi to the United States is to counter China’s influence in Indo-Pacific?

MR KIRBY: No.

QUESTION: And secondly, I would like to take this opportunity to ask you about the White House and President Biden’s assessment of Secretary Blinken’s trip to Beijing. In China there are critics questioning the United States sincerity saying actions and words are inconsistent. So how can you prevent – how can you actually keep the momentum Secretary Blinken built in Beijing to prevent it from derail?

MR KIRBY: Well, that’s the goal. First of all, you heard the President talk about this himself over the weekend that he felt like Secretary Blinken did a terrific job on this trip to Beijing. You have to remember the goal here was to get even more lines of communication open and to try to advance this competition that we’re in in a responsible way. And Secretary Blinken has spoken to this himself as he left Beijing that he felt like his visit helped get that process back on track. And that’s what we were focused on.

And now it remains for both sides to do what we can to drive that – from the initial conversations we had, to drive them forward to meaningful results. So the answer to your question is we’re going to see. And I can assure you that the Biden administration will do everything that we can to achieve that goal and to work towards that end. And you head Secretary Blinken say as well that now that he has visited it’s possible now – and we hope – that you’ll see other high-level officials heading off to Beijing.

Now, we still have work to do, which is one of the takeaways from this was establishing a team approach at lower levels for both countries, lower-level diplomats to start working together to see if we can’t still stitch together and improve some of the lines of communication that are not and still have not been agreed to reopen. And the one I’m speaking about chiefly is of course the military-to-military line, which the Chinese did not agree to. It doesn’t mean it’s never going to happen. That’s why it’s important for the two teams now to work together to see what we can do to get that moving forward. At a time right now when tensions are high, particularly in the security realm, it is that much more important that the military channels find a way to get opened up here so that we can have more conversation, more dialogue, to reduce the risk of miscalculation.

Yeah. I promise, I’ll work around. I promise. I’ve got an hour. I’m not going anywhere.

QUESTION: Thank you so much, Admiral. Welcome back, as usual. Alex Raufoglu from Turan News Agency. I’m just wondering how much of the fact that India purchases Russian oil and gas, which allows Putin to fund his war in Ukraine, is problematic when it comes to Russia – U.S.-Ukraine – U.S.-Iran – Indian relationship. And what is the strategy here in terms of, let’s say, touching upon these sort of topics when President meets (inaudible) with Prime Minister Modi? Is the strategy we should stick with the friendly topics as long as we’re okay with our relationship, just avoid – as long as we don’t talk about issues such as purchasing Russian oil? Or to raise this concern and get him and the same (inaudible) you mentioned that you are – you prefer to have rule-based order, and is that your expectation from Prime Minister Modi to highlight that?

More broadly, a second question.

MR KIRBY: That was only one question?

QUESTION: Level of concern just (inaudible) —

MR KIRBY: You’ve got to be kidding me?

QUESTION: What’s your level of concern when it comes to Russia evading sanctions? The administration recently named the names, five countries you guys highlighted from Kazakhstan to Armenia, to Georgia, to Türkiye. Now, some of them are Russian partners. I understand when it comes to countries such as Georgia, which in itself suffers from Russian invasion. What can you do about it to prevent this from happening?

MR KIRBY: About sanctions evasion from whom?

QUESTION: From countries such as Georgia and other countries that are helping Russia to evade the sanctions when it comes to electronics and other.

MR KIRBY: Well look, on the sanctions evasions question, I mean, this is why we have constant dialogue with allies and partners and friends in the region and around the world. We don’t want to see anybody try to skirt these sanctions. We want to see Mr. Putin held to account and the Kremlin held to account.

Now, obviously every nation has to make these decisions for themselves, but our view has been very clear. We want to see all the international sanctions ascribed to and enforced appropriately so that Mr. Putin can’t benefit. And we have no compunction about having conversations privately with allies, partners, and friends throughout the world, certainly on the European continent, about our concerns in that regard. But obviously we wouldn’t get into detailing what the diplomatic conversations are.

On your – on the first 17 questions that you asked, look, let me boil it down this way. India is a key and important partner not just in the Indo-Pacific but globally for the United States. In fact, it’s one of the most defining bilateral relationships in the world. Now, and if you just look ahead, look at where things are going, not just – not just in that region but elsewhere, I think it’s safe to say that it’s going to be one of the most defining and important bilateral relationships well into the future.

And so in the context of that, you can expect that over the next few days President Biden and Prime Minister Modi will have wide-ranging discussions about a lot of issues. Some issues are always easier to talk about than others, but that’s what partners do. You have those kinds of conversations. I’m not going to get ahead of them, and I’m certainly not going to speak for either leader until they have a chance to speak for themselves at the end of their visits and meetings. But I think you will see that the agenda that they end up discussing is very robust and covers a lot of issues.

And as I’ve said earlier, President Biden never shies away, nor would you expect him to, from having conversations with foreign leaders about issues that – on which we don’t always see eye to eye. That’s important. That’s why you have visits. That’s why you have meetings. That’s why you have these discussions so that you can work through all of those things.

But this is not only a very important visit for us, but this is a hugely important bilateral relationship that the President and his entire team – Secretary of State Blinken, Secretary of Defense Austin, the Secretary of Commerce – have all put a lot of energy into, including the Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry – all of whom have put a lot of effort into in seeing in ways we can deepen and improve our cooperation and our relationship with India. And again, I think you’re going to see that on full display this week.

Yeah, in the back there. Go ahead. The orange tie.

QUESTION: Admiral Kirby, good to see you. I’m Saurabh Shula from NewsMobile in India. You spoke about India as a defining – India’s partnership with the U.S. as a defining partnership for the next decade. Can you spell out what are the three big outcomes that you are expecting from this state visit, because there’s a lot of expectation here in the U.S., in India, and rest of the world, and people are watching very closely this big state visit of Prime Minister Narendra —

MR KIRBY: Yeah. I think, again, without getting ahead of the leaders, I think you’ll – you can expect to see meaningful, tangible, deliverables in several different categories. One will be on health, global health. And I talked about the pandemic a little bit earlier in my opening comments, but we cooperated very, very strongly with India to address COVID-19, and I think you’ll hear the leaders talk about global health cooperation going forward.

I think you’ll hear, as I said earlier just in my previous answer, you’re going to see them talk about deliverables in the realm of the climate crisis and addressing climate change. You’ll certainly hear them talk about defense cooperation. I’ve already talked about that a lot. I think you’ll hear some discussion and deliverables with respect to emerging technologies, and I’m going to lump space in there, although it’s probably not fair for me to do that. But space and emergent technologies, cyberspace – I think you’ll see some deliverables in that regard.

And then lastly – and by lastly, I don’t mean that it’s least important; in fact, in many ways, it’s the most important – but it’s the peopletopeople ties. And you’re going to hear both of these leaders talk about ways in which we can make more enriching the people-to-people, cultural, educational exchanges that we already have, deepening them, making them more meaningful, because that really is the root of the strength of the bilateral relationship 10, 15 years out in the future. It’s going to be the young people that are going to be the future leaders of both their countries, and so we want to make sure that we’re investing properly in their growth, in their development, in their mutual understanding, and in the relationships that they will take forward into the future. So there’s going to be an awful lot on the agenda, but those are sort of the top five areas that I would cite.

Let me come over here, ma’am. Yeah.

QUESTION: Thank you very much. Christiane Jacke from the German Press Agency DPA. I have a quick follow-up on China on the Secretary Blinken’s visit. Now that you are working on – actively working on opening up the lines of communication, how likely or unlikely is a bilateral, like face-to-face meeting between President Biden, President Xi in India at the G7 and G20 Summit and in San Francisco at the APEC Summit later this year?

And if I might add a super-fast second question, is there any timeline for the President’s trip to Africa this year already?

MR KIRBY: So on both questions, I really don’t have anything on the schedule to speak to, either a trip to the continent or to a meeting with President Xi. You heard the President over the weekend say that he does expect to be meeting and connecting with President Xi at the appropriate time, and he’ll do that. Whether that occurs at the G20 or not, I just can’t say right now.

It is important that Secretary Blinken was able to make this trip to Beijing. It’s just as, if not more, important that our two teams now start to work on improving the lines of communication between our two countries, and hopefully that will involve follow-on visits by other cabinet officials. We’ll see where that goes.

And clearly, as the President has said many, many times, that President Xi is a leader who he has known for a very, very long time. They have spoken many times. They had a terrific three- hour meeting in Bali, and he looks forward to having follow-on conversations and discussions with President Xi in the future. And that will happen. And when it does, and we have something more to say about that, we certainly will.

Yeah, in the blue.

QUESTION: Thank you so much, Mr. Kirby. I appreciate it. Igor Naymushin of RIA Novosti News Agency, Washington Bureau. So two questions, first one about Russian oil revenues. The U.S. administration has always been very clear that each country should make its own choice whether to buy Russian oil or not. Whether – nevertheless, if we’re looking at such a dramatic growth of Indian imports of Russian oil, doesn’t it concern the White House that all efforts to decrease Russian oil revenues results only in shifting its supply chains?

And the second question is about defense cooperation and arm trades. Is the U.S. administration committed to displace Russia from the Indian arms market and decrease its share? Thank you so much.

MR KIRBY: So on your first question, the price cap is working. It has proven effective in limiting the amount of revenue that Mr. Putin can take from his oil exports and the market to then turn around and fund this war in Ukraine. It’s working, and we’re gratified to see that, and we certainly hope that, in the case of India, that they will continue to purchase oil inside the cap. Now, obviously, that’s for them to decide. We don’t tell other nations how to handle their bilateral relations, so I won’t speak for the Modi government, but we hope that they will continue to buy in keeping with the cap, because it is working and it is having an effect on (A) keeping the supply in the market stable but (B) not allowing Mr. Putin to profiteer off of it.

And then on the arms market question, again, India should and must speak for itself when it comes to the relationships that it has around the world, particularly in the realm of defense. So I won’t speak for the – Prime Minister Modi or the Indian Government and where and how they see their defense cooperation going forward. All I can tell you is what I said earlier, that we have seen in recent years, particularly since the beginning of the Biden administration, that defense cooperation between our two countries has improved, and we are looking – and you’ll see quite a focus on it this week in particular – we’re looking to deepen that, to broaden it, and to find opportunities to improve that defense cooperation between the – between India and the United States. And again, I – without getting ahead of where things are, I think you’ll see that that will come to pass here before the end of the week. And that’s all to the good because we have a shared interest and a shared common goal of a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific, and India is a major exporter of security in the Indo-Pacific region, and they certainly have equities of their own to speak to.

So we’re looking forward to where this is going. It’s not about – the question about whether this was about China. This state visit is also not about Russia, and what we’re trying to do with our bilateral relationship with India is improve the bilateral relationship on its own – for its own sake and on its own foundation, because it’s that important to us. It’s not about forcing or coercing or trying to convince Prime Minister Modi or the Indian Government to do something different. It’s about focusing on where we are in this relationship and making it more important, more robust, more cooperative going forward. That’s what our focus is.

Yeah.

QUESTION: Thank you. Lalit Jha from PTI. How would you describe the evolution of this relationship in the last nine years under the Modi government?

And secondly, we are – in defense cooperation, we’re talking about co-production, co-development. These are long-term things. But in the short term, when India has more challenging needs from the neighbors north and west, in what way U.S. and India can cooperate, coordinate together in which India can successfully address those challenges coming from the neighborhoods, including its territorial integrity?

MR KIRBY: Well, I think you’re going to see that play out this week, Lalit. I mean, you’re going to see some robust discussion here about improving our defense cooperation with a deep and solemn respect for Indian prerogatives and Indian choices, and certainly with a recognition that India’s a sovereign state and must choose for itself the direction it wants to take in terms of its own security and the regional security that it is increasingly providing – exporting security.

We certainly want to be a part of that discussion with India. We certainly want to be a part of that future with India. But we certainly respect that these are decisions that India has to make, and as I said earlier, you’re going to see as – over the course of this week – and I won’t – the leaders will speak for themselves about some of the ways we’re going to specifically improve and deepen defense cooperation.

Now, on your first question, look, I’m not qualified to speak about the last nine years of Prime Minister Modi’s leadership. All I can tell you is in the last two and a half years under this administration, President Biden has really put a premium in general, broadly speaking, on revitalizing our vast network of alliances and partnerships, and India is one of those key strategic partners. And they have been just a huge part of the Quad, the Pacific Quad. I think, as you know, we also look for ways to work more cooperatively with India multilaterally through the I2U2 arrangement, largely focused on the Middle East. So there’s an awful lot – not to mention just the bilateral opportunities between us in trade, in investments, and as I said earlier, in people-to-people ties.

So we’re focused on the future. And I really do believe – at the risk of sounding like I’m being corny here, I really do believe that at the end of the week when these two leaders have a chance to summarize their discussions, you’re going to see that the discussion this week was really focused on the future – the future of this bilateral relationship but also the future of the Indo-Pacific region writ large.

Let me go back over here. Yes, ma’am, in the front there. I’ll come back to you.

QUESTION: Seema Sirohi I’m a columnist for The Economic Times in India, an Indian newspaper. U.S. officials have raised expectations high about this visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. That is a kind of a sea change from just a few years ago, so when India was, let’s say, a second-tier interest – of interest. India was a second-tier country in terms of U.S. interest. It was all about Pakistan, China, and U.S. sort of focusing on that. So what changed from your point of view, from the U.S. point of view, that now India is everything? It’s the country of the future.

MR KIRBY: Well, all I can tell you is that in President Biden’s mind, India is not a second-tier anything. India matters significantly to President Biden and to this administration, and not just in South Asia or the Indo-Pacific region but truly globally. And again, I don’t – I don’t want to sound like a broken record, but I think when you see some of the deliverables coming out of this visit, you’ll see the true global impact of some of the ways in which our bilateral relationship is really acting not just for the betterment of our two peoples or any one region of the world but truly around the world. So you’ll see that come out of this.

All I – again, the only way I can answer your question is to sort of say what I’ve said before. Coming into office, President Biden saw that our relationships around the world in many cases, many places, were eroding, tattering, and trust and confidence in the United States as a partner, a friend, in some cases an ally, was beginning to fade. And he immediately set forth an assertive but cooperative foreign policy to revitalize those relationships, because President Biden knows that there’s very few problems around the world that any one nation can solve for itself. We need each other.

We absolutely – when you look at certainly the transnational problem, whether it’s terrorism, whether it’s the next pandemic, climate change, those – global health, food security, energy security – I could go on and on. When you look at the problem set before leaders like Prime Minister Modi and President Biden, it’s pretty easy to see that you gotta to have teamwork here, and that some nations can bring to the problem solving set skills and experience, technologies, innovation, investments that another nation may not be able to put forward, and so together you can really have an outsized impact.

And the President has long believed that. And when he came into office, again, he set forward a foreign policy that was going to focus on that, on the benefit of multilateral cooperation and to restoring some of the trust and confidence that had been eroded in the United States ability to lead on the world stage. And that’s what he’s doing.

And I think – again, you don’t have to – look multilaterally. Look at the – look at what President Biden’s leadership has done with respect to supporting Ukraine – not just bolstering and strengthening the NATO Alliance, which is now bigger than it was when President Biden came into office, but around the world. More than 50 nations around the world are coming together on a routine basis about every six weeks to find ways to continue to support Ukraine. And India has been a terrific contributor of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine but also bilaterally in working at the grassroots level in bilateral relationships to address common concerns and move towards the achievement of common goals with shared interests. And that’s exactly what you’re going to see on display here this week.

Yes, sir. In the aisle there with the white shirt.

QUESTION: Thank you. Diyar Kurda, Rudaw Media Network. I will take this opportunity to ask a question about northeast Syria. Türkiye hastened its fight – it is airstrikes and also drone strikes on northeast Syria. Today they attacked – they targeted a car, and they killed the co-chair of the —

MR KIRBY: I’m sorry. Who conducted this attack?

QUESTION: Türkiye.

MR KIRBY: Türkiye. Okay.

QUESTION: Yeah. Türkiye, the Kurds, the drone attack on a car which they killed Qamishli cochair municipality and also three other people, which they were civilians. Do you have any engagement with Türkiye and also SDF to de-escalate the situation?

MR KIRBY: I have not seen those reports, sir, so I’m going to – I’m going to decline comment on that particular reporting because I’ve just not seen that.

I would just reiterate our mission inside Syria is in part of the – as part of the Counter-ISIS coalition, we do work with the SDF to go after ISIS targets because ISIS is still, although much weaker, still a viable threat there in Syria and even in Iraq. So we’re going to continue that work jointly in cooperation with our SDF partners.

We have – again, without speaking to this particular reporting, we have certainly maintained lines of communication open with Türkiye. Türkiye has legitimate security concerns on that border. They have been victim of – they have fallen victim to terrorist attacks from across that border. We understand that. We also understand it’s important to make sure that Türkiye understands what we’re doing in Syria and why we’re doing it and who we’re working with and why we’re working with them. But again, I can’t go into any more detail than that.

Yes, ma’am. Yeah. No, right behind. There. Yeah. She’s had her hand up all day. Go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you so much, Mr. Kirby. Ines Pohl with Deutsche Welle. This is Germany’s international broadcaster. I have two questions. Given Vice President Kamala Harris and family bonds with India, which role does she play during this state visit? Is it different from other state visits?

And my second question is how important is it in your opinion for the Americans with Indian roots that President Biden addresses human rights issues in India? Thank you.

MR KIRBY: So the Vice President is going to be a full party to this state visit, as you might imagine, and I know she will be having opportunities, including a lunch that she’ll be hosting for the prime minister and his staff to engage specifically and directly with the prime minister. And I’ll let her office speak to that with more detail, but she’s looking forward to that. And you’re right; I mean, her family heritage is certainly noteworthy with respect to this visit.

And then on the question of human rights, I know there are millions, several millions of Indian Americans here in this country, and we understand that they, as actually anybody, would have concerns over human and civil rights. And as I said earlier, we don’t shy away from addressing those concerns privately. We don’t shy away from addressing those concerns publicly. And everywhere the President goes, where and when it’s appropriate and when it’s a significant issue, he raises those concerns. And again, I don’t think that this week will be any exception to that.

So we certainly understand where people are coming from on that, and I can assure them, Indian Americans but all Americans, that this is something the President takes seriously. And certainly, we’ll address it.

Yeah.

QUESTION: Thank you. My name is Pavel Zakovorotnyy. I’m from Sputnik News, Russia. Two quick questions. First, do you believe Prime Minister Modi shares President Biden’s view of the conflict in Ukraine, including the massive sanctions against Russia, and does it pose any challenge for the bilateral relations if not?

MR KIRBY: Does it pose any challenge for the —

QUESTION: For the bilateral relations with India.

And my second question is about the Black Sea Grain deal. The Russian foreign ministry today said that the grain deal will likely end on July 18th without extension because neither of Russian conditions have been fulfilled by the Western countries. Do you have any comments here and do you think that Russia has benefitted at all from the Black Sea Grain deal?

MR KIRBY: The whole world has benefitted from this Black Sea Grain Initiative, and we’re grateful to President Erdogan of Türkiye and his leadership in keeping that initiative going, and the UN of course keeping that initiative going and extending. And we’ve seen the comments that are deeply unfortunate that Russia would signal that there may not be an extension. This initiative has benefitted people around the world, particularly in the so-called Global South, who have suffered from food insecurity as a result of Russians’ – the Russian war in Ukraine.

So we certainly hope that it will get extended. We will continue to support, as needed, the UN and President Erdogan as appropriate in terms of seeing if we can’t get that extended, because it really – it does matter to people well outside the region.

And as for your first question, I think that’s a question that I would refer to Prime Minister Modi. I mean, he should speak to his government’s view of the war in Ukraine and the degree to which they believe Mr. Putin is being held accountable for the war there. We know that they have contributed humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. That’s welcome. And through statements and through votes at the UN, India has made clear its deep concern about what Russia is doing inside Ukraine.

We talked about oil. Again, the Indians should speak for themselves when it comes to the oil they buy, but we certainly hope that they will continue to purchase it at or below the price cap levels, which they have.

So again, I think the broader question that you’re asking, though, is really one that’s better put to them, not to us.

Yeah, in the back there. Go ahead. Wait. Wait for the microphone. s

QUESTION: Thank you, Admiral. Sriram Lakshman from The Hindu. My question is: What is the administration’s strategy to ensure that the long list of deliverables from this visit and going forward – deliverables which are derived from the iCET platform, for example – what’s the strategy to ensure that they don’t keep running up against ITAR and other legislation? Because I understand that it may not be an issue for the jet engines, for example, but this is a medium- to long-term issue. So are you thinking of a carveout, to push Congress on a carveout, reimagine ITAR? What’s the strategy there?

MR KIRBY: Oh, you’re getting further ahead than where I’m prepared to go here today. I would just tell you that you’re going to see a robust set of deliverables across all those five areas I talked about earlier: climate change, technology, space, cyber, people-to-people, and certainly defense cooperation. And we will, as we have in this and any other bilateral relationship, work closely with Congress so that they’re fully informed and fully – and able to fully support the kinds of things that we want to continue to do bilaterally with India. But I won’t go into more detail than that.

Yes, ma’am.

QUESTION: Hi, yes, Yasmine El-Sabawi, TRT World. I know you touched on the human rights issue more broadly, but if you could speak to this specifically, the Council on American-Islamic Relations are urging members of Congress not to attend Prime Minister Modi’s address. We’ve seen from human rights organizations they’ve widely documented attempts by the Modi government, they say, of disenfranchising Muslims, turning a blind eye to widespread acts of violence. We’ve seen this administration and Republicans be quite outspoken about China’s crackdown on its Muslim minority. And so why in this case is a red carpet being rolled out for Prime Minister Modi?

MR KIRBY: So the question really gets to the importance of a state visit, and a state visit is not just about the red carpet and a terrific meal. It is about anchoring the relationship through a wide-ranging and very robust agenda of significant policy issues, and you’re going to see that this week, as I said earlier.

So why India? Why now? Take a look at the region. Take a look at the way in which this bilateral relationship has improved in the last two and a half years. And just as critically, take a look at where this relationship is going to be going in the next 10, 15 years and how vital this bilateral relationship will be not just to regional security but global security. All of that is reason enough to have a set of robust discussions and meetings and conversations with India about the future. And again, I don’t want to get ahead of the deliverables, but you’ll see, I think – well, I know what you’ll see – at the end of the week the full scope of the agenda and what we were able – what we hope to be able to get done sitting down with Mr. – Prime Minister Modi and his team.

That doesn’t mean that – democracy is tough. We know that. We’ve seen it firsthand here in this country. It’s tough; you’ve got to work at it. And India has a vibrant democracy, and they, too, work at it. No democracy at any given point in time reaches perfection. The idea of democracy is that you try to become more perfect – language that was in our own Constitution. And so we’re going to continue to work on this bilateral relationship between these two vibrant, relevant, strong, and influential democracies in the world to improve the relationship. And that means that in so doing, we’re also going to have conversations – we can have and we need to have somewhat uncomfortable conversations with our partners and our friends and our allies. That’s what you can do when you have – when you’re partners and friends and allies, is have conversations about uncomfortable issues.

And as I said, President Biden has never shied away from raising concerns over human rights, and he’s not going to start shying away from it this week. But that doesn’t mean that you also don’t discuss other areas where you are in full agreement about making the relationship stronger and more robust going forward, and we’ll do that.

But I find it interesting that the – and I’m not saying you suggested this, but the supposition is that if you have concerns with another nation, you – that you – that the way to address it is to not talk about it, to not – to not address it, to ignore it. And we obviously aren’t going to do that, nor are we – nor should we, and it would be irresponsible for us to ignore all the great opportunities and the promises that exist between these two countries going forward. And again, you’re going to see – you’re going to see a set of discussions and conversations that are very much focused on the future, a future that this bilateral relationship will be critical to.

I can take just a couple more. Yeah.

QUESTION: Hi, this is Jihan Abdalla from The National. I have actually two questions. The first – the West Bank, in Jenin – we’ve seen an incursion yesterday. Five were killed. Seems like another escalation in a part of the West Bank that’s on and off. What do you have to say about that?

The second question, about Iran – again, Israel has had a lot to say about this alleged deal, mini-deal, whatever we’re going to call it, with Iran.

MR KIRBY: Well, we’re not calling it a mini-deal.

QUESTION: (Laughter.) Agreement or whatever. Yes, any comments on how to counter what seems to be a lot of criticism from also U.S. lawmakers themselves and Israel’s distaste for it?

MR KIRBY: So on your first question, I mean, I’m only vaguely familiar with some of these initial reports, so I don’t know that I can speak specifically to them. But in general, we have said and we continue to say we don’t want to see any actions taken by either side to increase tensions. And we certainly don’t want to see violence by either side here. We want to see – what we want to see is a real commitment to de-escalating the tensions and stopping the violence. So I’ll leave it at that.

On your second question, there’s no deal to speak to. We have and we will continue to talk to the Iranians about detained Americans in their country, and we’re doing that, and we’re going to continue to do that because the President has made it a commitment to get wrongfully detained Americans back home with their families where they belong. And so that discussion’s ongoing.

At the same time, we’re certainly dealing with the full spate of destabilizing behaviors that we see out of Tehran, whether it’s attacking maritime shipping, which again happened just the last couple of weeks; their continuing efforts to improve their ballistic missile program; their support to terrorist networks in the Levant and throughout the region; and as – just as critically, their continued and deepening defense relationship with Russia and the support that they’re helping provide Russia in order so Russia can kill more Ukrainians. And I’m talking specifically about the provision of drones, and now indications that they’re going to help Moscow build a drone manufacturing facility on Russian soil.

So we’re going to deal with all that destabilizing behavior. And we’ve said, when it comes to their nuclear ambitions, I mean, clearly President Biden – well, I’ll start with this. He has made it clear that we will not allow Iran to achieve a nuclear weapons capability. He would prefer for us to be able to deal – to achieve that outcome through diplomacy. Right now, diplomacy in that realm is not on the table. It’s just – we’re not pursuing diplomacy towards their nuclear ambitions. But that doesn’t mean that the President still hasn’t committed himself to trying to have that solved diplomatically, if possible. Right now, that’s not the scope of the discussions that we’re having with Iran for a variety of reasons, some of which I just mentioned to you. And that means that the President wants and has available to him other options to make sure that that the outcome of a nuclear-armed Iran doesn’t become – doesn’t become possible.

I can take just one more. Yeah, in the – go ahead. No, wait for your microphone.

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR KIRBY: Okay, one more after that. You’re the last one.

QUESTION: Prashant Jha, Hindustan Times. Is there anything India is doing at the moment that U.S. would like to see Delhi do differently?

MR KIRBY: (Laughter.) We are very excited about this visit and about deepening and improving this bilateral relationship. And we wouldn’t have – President Biden wouldn’t have invented – invented – (laughter) – wouldn’t have invited Prime Minister Modi if he wasn’t strong and confident in the manner in which this bilateral relationship truly has deepened in the last two and a half years. And so we’re excited about that and we look forward to talking about it at the end of the week.

Yeah.

QUESTION: Thank you for taking my question. My name Malvika Jain. I’m from Times Now, a part of India’s largest news network. I have two questions for you. One is more specifically regarding Ukraine. You mentioned that there is a possibility for a third country to act as a mediator if certain conditions are met. Could that country be India?

And my second question is that in response to a question regarding human rights violations, you mentioned that U.S. will not refrain and has never refrained from expressing concerns if they are legitimate. Does U.S. believe that the prime minister was in violation of human rights issues? Because the supreme court of India has found no evidence against the prime minister, specifically in the case of the state of Gujarat, where he was a chief minister.

MR KIRBY: On the second question, I’m just going to leave it where I left it before. We routinely raise human rights concerns with our friends, our allies, our partners, even nations that we’re not so friendly with. We’re not bashful about raising those concerns, and we’ll continue to do that. And I think I’m just going to leave it there.

On your first question, could India be – I mean, that would obviously be up to Prime Minister Modi to determine whether he wanted India to take an assertive role in helping bring about a peace deal between Russia in Ukraine. I can just tell you what we’ve said before, which is we would welcome a constructive role played by a third-party country, whoever it is – we’ve said this about China as well – as long as it (A) included the perspectives of President Zelenskyy and factored in his own proposal for a just peace; (B) that it was work that was done in keeping with the principles of the UN Charter, to include sovereignty and territorial integrity being respected in Ukraine by internationally recognized borders; and (C) that it’s done in full transparency with President Zelenskyy. As President Biden has said, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. And so any peace proposal put forward by anybody that didn’t include Ukrainian perspectives is just a non-starter, not just for us, but for the Ukrainian people, and that’s to be well understood.

So, again, that’s a question that only Prime Minister Modi can answer. But certainly, we would welcome any credible, sustainable effort by a third-party country, again, as long as it met those guidelines and could be seen as credible and potentially sustainable by President Zelenskyy.

Now, look, I want to go back to one last thing I said – one thing I said at the beginning. We’d all like to see peace in Ukraine, and ideally that could happen today. We know it’s not. We know there’s a lot of vicious fighting going on. We know that Mr. Putin has prepared himself and continues to throw military capabilities into Ukraine, continues to launch drone and missile strikes inside – sometimes deep inside – Ukraine, and has continued in every way possible to continue to propagate this war and to further victimize the Ukrainian people, which is why President Biden and the United States is going to continue to support them in the battlefield as much as we can, so that if and when this can get to negotiations, President Zelenskyy can go into those negotiations from a position of strength, with the wind at his back, knowing that they have succeeded on the battlefield.

So that’s what we’re focused on, making sure that Ukraine can succeed on the battlefield, and other nations – some 50 other nations – are doing the same thing. And some nations – every nation has to decide for itself. Some are contributing other than security assistance, and that’s okay too. All of this is about sovereignty. I’ve said this the last time I was here, and so many of the questions I’ve gotten today really get at this idea of sovereignty. Every nation has to decide for itself what other countries it’s going to relate to and what those relations are going to look like, where and how much oil it buys, whether it’s going to support Ukraine with weapons or humanitarian assistance or nothing. Those are – the whole war in Ukraine is really about the idea of sovereignty and territorial integrity. It’s really about that UN Charter.

And so that’s what – when I – when we talk about a rules-based order – and that is something that Prime Minister Modi has been very clear about supporting, a rules-based order – that’s what we’re talking about. That’s what this discussion will all get around. And I think, again, as you look at the bilateral relationship between our two countries and the discussions that we’re going to have this week, you’ll see that it really does come down to respect for each other, respect for our democratic institutions, respect for the burgeoning and deepening defense cooperation that we’re enjoying now and we want to enjoy in the future, and – my last point – respect, again, for that future, for that future in the Indo-Pacific which has got to be secure, open, prosperous, and which we believe – President Biden believes – India is going to be a critical partner that.

Okay. Thanks, everybody. Appreciate it."
46,https://apnews.com/article/biden-modi-india-state-visit-human-rights-5e4bc32e679ad6bae7225a28f7f6334d,Biden and Modi cheer booming economic ties in visit that also reckoned with India’s record on rights,2023-06-22 09:03:50,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Thursday pronounced the U.S.-India relationship never stronger and rolled out new business deals with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as human rights activists and American lawmakers questioned the administration’s decision to honor the leader with a pomp-filled state visit.

In a joint news conference with Modi, Biden called the relationship between the U.S. and India among the most consequential in the world and “more dynamic than at any time in history.” He underscored how two of the world’s most powerful democracies were cooperating on issues such as the climate, health care and space, saying that the U.S-India economic relationship was “booming.”

But Modi bristled at a reporter’s question about his country’s commitment to democratic values as the country has seen an erosion of religious, political and press freedoms under his watch.

“Democracy is our spirit,” Modi, who rarely takes questions from journalists, said through an interpreter. “Democracy runs in our veins. We live democracy and our ancestors have actually put words to this concept.” He said India has “proved that democracies can deliver and when I say deliver, this is regardless of class, creed, religion, gender.”

Yet Modi has faced criticism over legislation amending the country’s citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalization for some migrants but excludes Muslims, a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists, and the recent conviction of India’s top opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modi’s surname.

Nevertheless, later in a 59-minute address before a joint meeting of Congress, Modi insisted that in India “diversity is a natural way of life.”

“We are home to all faiths in the world, and we celebrate all of them,” added Modi, in a line that brought many cheering lawmakers to their feet.

The premier’s description runs counter to accusations by rights groups of widespread attacks and discrimination against India’s Muslims and other minorities under Modi.

A group of more than 70 lawmakers wrote to Biden this week urging him to raise concerns about the erosion of religious, press and political freedoms during the visit. At least six Democratic lawmakers —Democratic Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Greg Casar of Texas, Jamaal Bowman and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — boycotted Modi’s address to Congress, because of concerns about his human rights records.

“When it comes to standing up for human rights, actions speak louder than words,” Bush, Tlaib, Omar and Bowman said in a joint statement. “By bestowing Prime Minister Modi with the rare honor of a joint address, Congress undermines its ability to be a credible advocate for the rights of religious minorities and journalists around the world.”

Standing alongside Modi, Biden emphasized that press, religious and other fundamental freedoms should be at the core of how both democracies operate. During their Oval Office meeting, Biden said, he and Modi had a “good discussion about democratic values” while Modi said “there’s absolutely no space for discrimination” when pressed about his own commitment on human rights.

The state visit, just the third of the Biden’s presidency, was certainly a glitzy affair.

Thousands gathered on the White House South Lawn for the welcoming ceremony, listening to performances by violinist Vibha Janakiraman and the a cappella group Penn Masala. As Modi arrived, the crowd — including many members of the Indian diaspora — broke out in a chant of “Modi, Modi, Modi.”

“All eyes are on the two largest democracies in the world, India and America,” Modi said. “I believe that our strategic partnership is important. I’m confident that working together will be successful.”

Later, Modi told Congress that “our partnership augurs well for the future of democracy” as the two countries expand partnerships in defense, semiconductor manufacturing and other industries. He also cheered the “samosa caucus”—the five U.S. House members of Indian descent—and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is Black and of Indian descent, as examples of the impact of the diaspora.

Biden administration officials say honoring Modi, the leader of the conservative Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is Diplomacy 101. The U.S.-India relationship will be vital in coming decades as both sides navigate an ascendant China and the enormity of climate change, artificial intelligence, supply chain resilience and other issues.

“On the issues that matter most that will define the future, our nations look to one another including on critical regional and global issues,” Biden said.

Among the announcements made Thursday is an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.

The Biden administration also announced plans to bolster India’s semiconductor industry. U.S.-based Micron Technology has agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending more than $800 million and India financing the rest. U.S.-based Applied Materials will launch a new semiconductor center for commercialization and innovation in India, and Lam Research, another semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will start a training program for 60,000 Indian engineers.

On the space front, India signed on to the Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space exploration cooperation among nations participating in NASA’s lunar exploration plans. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station next year.

“We made critical and emerging technologies the pillar of our next generation partnership to ensure these technologies promote and protect our values, remain open, accessible, trusted and secure,” Biden added. “All this matters for America, for India and for the world.”

At the welcoming ceremony, Modi called the Indian diaspora in America — the millions of immigrants and their children from the subcontinent living in the U.S. — “the real strength” of the U.S.-India relationship. He said the honor of a formal state visit — the first in the U.S. for India since Barack Obama honored Modi’s predecessor, Manmohan Singh, in 2009 — reflected the positive impact Indians are having worldwide.

Modi, the son of a tea seller who rose to be India’s premier, also recalled that the first time he visited the White House was three decades ago as a “common man.”

“I have come here many times but today for the first time, the doors of the White House have been opened for the Indian American community in such large numbers,” Modi said to an estimated crowd of 7,000.

Despite the major deals, the visit was shadowed by concerns laid out by rights activists and lawmakers who question Modi’s commitment to democratic principles.

In 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi’s visa to the U.S., citing concerns that, as chief minister of the state of Gujarat, he did not act to stop communal violence during 2002 anti-Muslim riots that left more than 1,000 people dead. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.

Biden and Modi have also had differences over Russia’s war in Ukraine. India abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and refused to join the global coalition against Russia. Since the start of the war, the Modi government has also dramatically increased its purchase of Russian oil.

White House officials note that there are signs of change in India’s relationship with Russia, which has long been New Delhi’s biggest defense supplier.

India is moving away from Russian military equipment, looking more to the U.S., Israel, Britain and other nations. Modi recently met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and has spoken out about his worries about the potential use of nuclear weapons by Russia.

Modi, before Congress, said the war is “causing great pain” in Ukraine and having residual effects on Europe and beyond.

“This is not an era of war, but it is one of dialogue and diplomacy” Modi said. “And we must all do what we can to stop the bloodshed and human suffering.”

Without specifically naming China, Modi also addressed heightened tensions in the region, saying “dark clouds of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo Pacific.”

Later Thursday, Modi attended a lavish White House state dinner in his honor.

47,https://thewire.in/security/modi-us-visit-security-vulnerability,Modi’s US Visit Has Increased India’s Vulnerabilities,,"Geopolitical rivalry with China has brought India and the US into the tight strategic embrace which was on ample display during the recent state visit to Washington of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The US needs India for global geopolitics while India wants the US for regional geopolitics.

The only problem is that the US, having identified China as its sole geopolitical competitor in this century – with the capability to match it in economy, technology, diplomacy, and military – has failed to accept that its deterrence (military power) model of the Cold War is unsuitable against the Chinese geopolitical model, which is based more on global cooperation for prosperity than military power alone.

Even in a fragmented world, the Chinese model cannot fail. Changing the game from free trade to weaponised trade by ‘decoupling’ or ‘de-risking’ value chains and supply chain networks from dependence on China – still the world’s biggest trading partner – will only add to geopolitical tensions with the global economy heading towards recession.

Unmindful of the disastrous fall-out of the Ukraine war on the global economic order led by the US dollar, the reluctance of its regional allies to openly confront China and the own recent experience of its top diplomat being lectured by Chinese supremo Xi Jinping, the US has decided to bet on India to build it as a military bulwark against China in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

The long-term bet is based on the assumption that Prime Minister Modi will win the 2024 general elections and will not normalise India’s relations with China in this decade — the time it would take for deliverables promised by each side to take shape. The other assumption is that, if push comes to shove, India, as claimed by its political and military leadership, will be able to take on the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in a border war.

Ironically, the huge jubilation in India regarding the Modi visit missed the point that under the new transactional arrangement, India would end up giving far more, including its strategic autonomy, than it will get in return – which will be further accentuated by the US’s irrepressible urge (as seen during the 2005-2008 civil nuclear deal negotiations) to shift the goalposts.

The US agenda

So, what does the US want from India?

It wants commonality of military equipment by slowly weaning India (the largest arms importer in the world) away from Russia, its traditional, affordable, and trusted partner. It wants to improve Indian naval dockyards to serve as temporary military bases for its assets (vessels of all hue, including nuclear submarines and carriers) in the IOR. It also wants the Indian military (especially the navy) to do advanced exercises bilaterally and multi-laterally with the Quad navies for developing interoperability for combat in the IOR, which India considers its backwaters. Since the character of war has changed with new-age technologies, the US wants to pull up the technological level of the Indian military through the newly crafted India-United States Defence Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X), which is part of the bigger Innovation on Critical and Emerging Technologies (ICET) framework whereby it will be able to operate within the US Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) defence network under its ‘integrated deterrence’ strategy by the end of this decade.

All this has become possible as India (which is neither a military ally nor a non-NATO ally) has signed the US military’s four foundational agreements which qualify it to be part of the US’s new age networks. Thus, by 2030, India will fulfil all the requirements for interoperability: commonality of equipment, advanced military exercises, combat support facilities like MROs (maintenance, repair, operations) from the US, and familiarity with various war contingencies in the IOR.

Moreover, as part of iCET, India will adopt US rules, regulatory, norms, and standards in the new age fourth industrial technologies for trade and commerce since US companies will have first user advantage in India. Thus, given the certainty of the splinternet (bifurcation of the Internet and the value supply chains) based on US and Chinese technologies, India will get strategically isolated from its South Asian neighbours, all of which are onboard the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative), which will be based on the Chinese internet by 2030.

GE engines and technology transfer

Let’s now examine the deals individually, starting with General Electric’s memorandum of understanding with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).

According to the GE press release, it will deliver 99 F-414 engines for Indian Air Force (IAF) Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mk2 programme. GE will also help with the ‘prototype development, testing, and certification of the AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft) programme with its F-414-INS6 engine’. Moreover, GE will provide 99 F-404 engines for the LCA Mk1 programme. Both GE engines (F-404 and F-414) have already been part of the development of LCA Mk1 and LCA Mk2 programmes.

Three observations are in order. One, there will be no transfer of technology (ToT) of turbofan and casting technologies and even metallurgy formulae which make up almost 95 per cent of the engine’s Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs). It stands to logic that GE, which has spent huge amounts of time, resources, and talent creating the engine, cannot hand over its IPRs to India and create a competitor for itself. All India will get is engine assembly rights (called indigenous production in India), like we have for Russian AL-31FP engines for the Su-30MKI, which are being made in Koraput since 2004. The remaining five per cent ToT which includes tools for engine maintenance may be allowed by GE after the US Congress clears it. Thus, the IAF will be saddled with the burden of maintaining yet another engine besides British, Russian, and French.

Two, the US will make a strong bid for the IAF’s urgent operational need of 114 fighter jets under the Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) and the Indian Navy’s carrier-borne fighter programmes, in both of which Boeing’s Super Hornet, powered by GE-F414 engines, is a contender. Cheaper than the Rafale, the Super Hornet has been in US military service since 1999 with various upgrades. The IAF will be saddled with one more fighter, when it wants to reduce its types of combat aircraft. The Super Hornet, if it comes to the IAF and the Indian Navy, will be Prime Minister Modi’s choice rather than the Services’ Headquarters, which favours Rafale.

Three, while care will be taken by the Indian side to make an impregnable legal case against US sanctions on GE F-414, the US is not known to care much for legalities. A case in point is the freedom of navigation patrols by US Navy vessels in the South China Sea (SCS) and Taiwan Strait citing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) when the US has not even ratified the universal convention.

Why drones are no big deal

Regarding drones, India has agreed to buy 31 General Atomics (GA) MQ-9B (Sea Guardian and Sky Guardian) armed and unarmed drones under Foreign Military Sales (FMS) for the price of approximately US$3 billion. The offset amount of this deal will be used by GA to establish an MRO facility in India. These drones (also called Predators and Reapers) are extremely expensive, slow-moving, and completely out of sync with present and future trends in warfare. On the positive side, these drones carry big payloads, and have good range and mission capability since they are equipped with electro-optic video cameras, laser designators, good communication relay with ground stations, good electromagnetic systems, and signal intelligent equipment. They also have endurance of 40 hours. On the downside, with slow speed they are vulnerable and can be shot down by enemy air defence systems. Moreover, they lack autonomy (AI), are not stealthy and, most of all, require a lot of people on the ground to operate them.

In his book Army of None, US analyst Paul Scharre writes, ‘Predator and Reaper drone operations require seven to ten pilots to staff one drone orbit of 24/7 continuous around-the-clock coverage over an area. Another 20 people per orbit are required to operate the sensors on the drone, and scores of intelligence analysts are needed to sift through the sensor data. In fact, because of these substantial personnel requirements, the US Air Force has a strong resistance to calling these aircraft unmanned.’

The irony is that when these UAVs had a lucrative market in the early 2000s, US laws did not allow their sale. Now, when the US has approved their export, many more cost-effective and better-performing drones with AI options are available. Incidentally, China is a leading exporter of military drones. There can only be two reasons for India buying these outdated and expensive drones: US pressure and the Indian military’s tendency to conflate capability with sophisticated weapon platforms.

What iCET and INDUS-X really represent

The US pressure for this purchase is for its Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) under the Indo-Pacific partnership which was announced in Tokyo in 2022. Under this, the Quad members are to do data collection and sharing of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) feeds with partners in Southeast Asia and Pacific nations. India, given its location, has a special responsibility which is evident from two things: It is the only country which has operational interaction with three US theatre commands namely, INDOPACOM, Central Command, and Africa Command. And the Indian Navy’s Gurgaon-based Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC), whose software has been supplied by US companies CISCO and Raytheon, will be the nerve centre of the MDA project. To keep data cyber-secure, new undersea cables will be laid connecting all Quad members.

To understand the iCET framework and the INDUS-X scheme – which have been touted as the biggest US offering to India since the civil-nuclear deal – it is essential to first understand the context. Following the 2012 discovery of Deep Learning which revolutionised AI, and conscious that most emerging technologies including AI were being incubated in the commercial sector, the Pentagon in 2015 opened its outpost called Defence Innovation Unit (DIU) in Silicon Valley. Staffed with mostly civilian software experts and a few retired and active-duty military officers, the DIU was to help identify advanced commercial technologies for military use.

Taking a cue from the Pentagon’s DIU, the Indian defence ministry, in April 2018, launched the Innovation for Defence Excellence (iDEX) scheme under the defence secretary for incubation of new age technologies development in defence and aerospace from within the industry, start-ups, civilian laboratories, academia and so on. Unfortunately, iDEX has not delivered for four reasons: it is headed by bureaucrats with little domain knowledge, many start-ups that get good funding are owned by former military officers with questionable links in the system, deserving start-ups with few resources are bought by the Defence Research and Development Organisation, and projects are time-bound, which stymies creativity, ideas, and innovations.

Worse, there is little clarity on new-age commercial technologies prioritisation and how to harness them for military use. For instance, there are 20 advanced commercial technologies to choose from for military use. These are AI (where all new age technologies converge), 5G wireless and advanced networking, sensors with edge computing, Internet of Things, biotechnology, robotics and autonomy, semiconductors, blockchain, virtual reality (for simulation), metaverse, star-link internet, natural languages processing, space, cyber, advanced manufacturing, energy storage technologies, quantum computing, brain-computer interface, genomics, and exoskeletons.

Meanwhile, aware that talent is the most important pillar of AI alongside data, hardware (microelectronics), and software (algorithms), and with many talented Chinese AI researchers leaving the US for China following the tech war, the US, which attracts talent from across the world (mostly Chinese and Indians) to remain the global innovation hub, seemed to be losing the competition for talent to China.

Against this backdrop, the Indian and US National Security Advisors met in January 2023 to launch the ICET framework to be the bridge between commercial and defence sectors. Under the ICET, the two sides launched the INDUS-X scheme chaired jointly by the Pentagon and India’s iDEX to identify Indian defence start-ups which will work with the US start-ups organised by the civilian US-India Business Council (USIBC) to design, prototype, test, and produce commercial technologies with application in ‘integrated deterrence’ network. While in theory, the money for identified start-ups will come from a joint development fund, in practice they will be funded by the Pentagon. This way, the US military will be able to match, if not beat, the PLA’s 2035 deadline of robotic war (called intelligentised war) and make up for its talent shortage using Indian researchers to meet the Chinese challenge of becoming the world’s primary AI innovation centre by 2030.

It is for this reason that the US is easing H1B and L1 visas procedures for Indian STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) graduates and research scholars to work in the US. This is a good thing for Indian scholars and start-ups who will gain knowledge by working in world-class innovation hubs. Of course, it would have been better if the Indian civilian start-ups could work directly with the DIU (instead of through the iDEX and the Pentagon) for the understanding of all advanced commercial technologies.

However, for India which prided itself on its strategic autonomy in foreign policy, allowing Indian shipyards to emerge ‘as a hub for maintenance and repair of forward deployed (in the IOR) US navy assets (navy ships and naval fighters)’ is too big a price to pay for Modi’s rousing welcome in the US. Taking forward the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Understanding (LEMOA) signed by the Modi government in 2016, which allowed re-fuelling and other turn-around facilities to the US naval assets on a case-to-case basis, the present arrangement will permit the US to upgrade Indian shipyards to berth US warships for long periods. Shorn of rhetoric, India has agreed to provide military basing to the US military.

The impact on China

The big question now is: How will China assess India’s tight embrace of the US? China will conclude that normalisation of relations with the Modi government will not be possible since India has sacrificed its strategic autonomy to accommodate US military interests in the IOR.

Worse, India has become the US’s first line of offence against Chinese interests and infrastructure in the South Asian region (by denouncing its Belt and Road Initiative as a debt trap). Moreover, in cahoots with the US, India will be seen to threaten China’s commerce and trade worth over US$4 trillion annually which passes through the 3,000 nautical miles IOR from the Strait of Hormuz to the Strait of Malacca. This, at a time when the Chinese deterrence in the IOR is a decade away.

Xi Jinping’s directive to the PLA was to prepare capabilities (deterrence) to meet the (US) challenge in West Pacific and the Indian border by 2027, and across Asia Pacific (including IOR) by 2035. The PLA has already achieved deterrence (and capabilities to fight if deterrence failed) ahead of its timeline in the West Pacific and is working on the entire region.

China’s deterrence in the West Pacific where it faces challenges in the Taiwan Strait and the South and East China Sea is based on the combination of its military power and economic power (its intense trade with ASEAN and US allies like Japan and South Korea). Given the advantage of its geography, and the formidable Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) firewall that the PLA has created against the US, China refused Antony Blinken’s request in Beijing for opening bilateral military communication to avert a crisis in the region. While the stated reason by China for doing this are the US sanctions on its defence minister, Gen. Li Shangfu, the actual reason is to discourage US freedom of navigation and air patrols in the waters and air space in the Chinese backyard. Much in line with the US’s Monroe Doctrine – which disallows the presence of outside powers in the Western hemisphere – China wants US military activities in West Pacific to end.

Meanwhile, aware of its eroded deterrence in the West Pacific, the US military is reinforcing its regional alliances, seeking a global role for NATO and strengthening its military bases in Hawaii and Guam.

Chinese deterrence outside the West Pacific will be based on its economic deterrence anchored on BRICS and BRI, and its military deterrence anchored on the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and cooperative security with nations onboard the BRI. Since prosperity is at the vanguard of the BRI, Xi Jinping has announced that the third BRI Forum will be held in Beijing this year. The actual dates of the Forum perhaps await progress on Xi’s pet project of ‘Xiongan (meaning brave and peaceful) New Area’, 100km outside Beijing which is being called the vice-capital of China. Named the ‘plan of a thousand years’ by Xi, this city, meant to de-congest Beijing by moving many governments, financial, medical, academic, and military headquarters here, is being built with cyberspace software connectivity (part of the Digital Silk Road, a sub-set of the BRI) using industrial internet technologies like blockchain, 5G, IoT, big data and so on. This smart city will become the blockchain hub in China with blockchain-based services. Given this, it will be a good idea for Xi to showcase this smart city close to Beijing to the Forum delegates for them to get a sense of how the new phase of BRI (cyberspace software connectivity) which will likely figure in Xi’s address, would usher in prosperity by industrial internet.

China’s economic deterrence for BRI nations will get delayed owing to the chip war with the US. For example, China has been denied advanced chips which are required in AI and data centres for computing, storage, and for servers. Slowing economic deterrence will affect military deterrence which is based on cooperative security (PLA working with host BRI nation’s security forces for the protection of Chinese infrastructure, interests, and people).

Given the likelihood of China’s military deterrence lagging behind the US – which is supported now by India in South Asia and the IOR – Beijing might decide to up the ante on its border. Since China sees the boundary problem with India as a dispute regarding its sovereignty, it may decide to upend the US’s growing integrated deterrence in the region by a short and decisive war with India. In that sense, Modi’s US embrace has increased India’s vulnerabilities.

The bilateral relationship has soared to new heights in recent years, particularly on economic, technological and defense issues. Underpinning these developments is both sides’ desire to counter China’s effort to project power and influence across the Indo-Pacific region. While Washington and New Delhi have their disagreements on issues like Russia’s war on Ukraine and human rights, they see the relationship as too strategically vital to be jeopardized by these differences.

USIP’s Tamanna Salikuddin, Vikram Singh, Sameer Lalwani and Daniel Markey analyze the significance of this visit, the difficult issues that will be on the table, and how China will factor will into the leaders’ discussions.

What is the significance of the state visit for both the United States and for India?

Salikuddin: Modi’s visit will be filled with substantive and ceremonial events, including a South Lawn welcome, a state dinner and an address to a joint session of Congress. While Modi has visited the United States several times, this will be his first state visit, demonstrating the depth of the bilateral U.S.-India relationship, which Biden has described as the “defining relationship” of the 21st century. Per the White House’s official announcement, “the visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space.”

While none of the official statements mention China, this visit is all about China. As U.S.-China competition is only becoming more intense and the Biden administration identifies China as its “pacing” challenge, India is one of the most important partners for the United States in its Indo-Pacific policy. While India actively counters China on its northern border, its deepening relationship with the United States make it part of the bulwark of nations committed to countering Beijing’s malign influence.

Beyond the convergence on China, India and the United States are seeking deeper ties on economic, defense and technological grounds. This visit is significant in cementing the partnership, and no detail is being left unchecked with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan visiting New Delhi in the last few weeks. This visit and the broader high-level U.S.-India engagements this year — including Biden’s planned trip to New Delhi in the fall — are a high-water mark in the bilateral relationship. Coming 18 years after the historic U.S.-India civil nuclear deal, these engagements highlight the remarkable progress that has been made in terms of expanding economic, social, technological and defense aspects of the U.S.-India relationship.

As Modi departed India, he reaffirmed the significance of the trip: “I am confident that my visit to the [U.S.] will reinforce our ties based on shared values of democracy, diversity, and freedom. Together we stand stronger in meeting the shared global challenges.”

What are the difficult topics that might be on the table, and how are Biden and Modi likely to navigate these?

Singh: Biden and Modi are determined to take U.S.-India relations to a new level with this visit, and part of having a mature strategic partnership is the ability to tackle difficult issues and areas of disagreement.

Issues that get a lot of media attention include policy differences on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and issues of human rights and democracy. More below-the-radar are key regional challenges like Afghanistan and Myanmar; enduring difficulties in a bilateral trade agenda; and finding a way to cooperate more on global governance, especially regulation of technology and the digital economy.

India will also seek progress in easing visas for Indian citizens, especially student visas and H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers, and U.S. commitments to greater technology sharing needed to implement the high-tech cooperation the leaders have rolled out.

A major change over the past decade is that the United States and India can now disagree on some issues and continue to work together on a large shared agenda. Given the strong personal bond Biden and Modi seem to have developed, expect them to be direct and forthright with one another in private and broadly supportive and celebratory in public.

On issues like Ukraine, intense private consultations will likely touch on assessments of the state of the conflict and the need to ensure Putin does not turn to nuclear weapons. Biden may seek Modi’s assessment of Putin and possible paths Russia might take to end the war. On Afghanistan, Modi and Biden may share assessments of Taliban, al-Qaida, ISIS and Pakistan-based militant threats since the U.S. withdrawal. India has kept a small diplomatic presence in Afghanistan and may encourage the United States to engage more actively to partner in preventing terrorism in and from the region.

Democracy and human rights, which get the most media attention, will not be avoided, but expect a similar pragmatic approach. U.S. leaders are concerned about democracy everywhere — including at home. Biden has taken an inclusive view that all democracies face challenges and that leaders of democracies should work together to improve durable democratic development. That will likely be the approach with India. U.S. leaders will welcome public comments or gestures from Modi in support of pluralistic democracy, but do not believe that lecturing India on these issues can be effective. A logical takeaway is that the United States will handle human rights concerns with India more like it does with a country like Poland.

First and foremost, Biden and Modi both pursue the interests of their own citizens, and they seem to understand each other on this basis. For Modi, this means development and meeting the basic needs of 1.4 billion people by transforming India into a modern, global technology powerhouse that competes with China. For Biden it means rebuilding the American middle class and maintaining America’s global leadership. Underneath the lofty rhetoric about two great democracies, these leaders see pragmatic benefits for their own people coming from deeper social, economic, political and security ties. They will manage the hard stuff to protect those gains.

How might the outcomes of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s recent trip to India shape conversations on defense and technology?

Lalwani: Austin’s trip to New Delhi two weeks ago helped finalize agreements and set the table for Modi’s historic state visit to Washington. The 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy called for more technology cooperation with allies and partners, which produced greater technology-sharing mechanisms with Australia (through the AUKUS deal with the United Kingdom) as well as with Japan. Now the United States appears poised to take some unprecedented steps toward the third partner in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, India.

U.S. technology cooperation with India is likely to include co-production and technology sharing of General Electric engines, which will be used in Indian military fighter jets to deter and defend against China. Additional Defense Department efforts involve a defense industrial cooperation roadmap to expedite co-production of military equipment; new programs to network both countries entrepreneurs, research labs, industry, and venture capital fueling defense innovations over the medium term; and enhanced scientific collaboration on emerging technologies in artificial intelligence, synthetic biology and robotics.

The strategic result will be twofold — enhanced Indian deterrence and greater trust in U.S.-India defense collaboration. First, in the near to medium term, India will be able to augment its military capabilities to defend against Chinese aggression, which ratcheted up with the Galwan crisis and clashes during the summer of 2020. The defense industrial roadmap involves four focus areas for fast-tracking technology cooperation: air combat and land mobility systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR); munitions; and the undersea domain awareness (UDA).

As India is able to quickly develop better ISR assets, it will be able to identify the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) maneuvers or gray zone incursions on their disputed continental border much earlier. Similarly, better UDA will enable India to better discern and track Chinese submarine activity in the Indian Ocean, and share that data with friends and partners. With both, detection will play a critical role in deterrence. Greater land mobility systems will help India to quickly surge forces and supplies to flashpoints along the disputed border with China, while longer range munitions can threaten to interdict PLA supply lines in the event of a conflict.

The second expected result of this technology sharing effort can be greater mutual trust in order to enhance collaboration in the Indo-Pacific. The trust generated from top-down and bottom-up technology cooperation may be less tangible yet is more significant. India has made no secret of its decades-long desire for a high-technology partnership, and the great lengths the U.S. government has gone to fulfill this deserve serves as a costly signal of its commitment and reliability. With this mutual trust, both partners will be better able to engage in more advanced joint assessments, contingency planning, and exercises as they prepare to backstop each other, interoperate together, and share the burdens of deterring aggression and securing the Indo-Pacific commons.

What are the most pressing issues the United States and India will be focused on when it comes to China?

Markey: The bedrock for cooperation between the United States and India lies in a shared interest in deterring Chinese territorial aggression and challenging the extension of China’s political influence and military presence in India’s backyard.

The most immediate concern is along the Line of Actual Control, the contested China-India land border, where China has made vast investments in military infrastructure that have already enabled it to push India from former patrolling points and could, in a worst-case scenario, even enable large-scale incursions into Indian territory. U.S. officials are eager to help India reinforce its own capacity to deter and defend against such attacks, as they pose a genuine near-term threat to Indian security and represent a dangerous precedent that could intimidate other less powerful states across the Indo-Pacific region. U.S. defense sales to India are intended to fill immediate capability gaps (for instance, to improve border surveillance with U.S.-made drones) as well as to co-manufacture future weapon systems (such as fighter jet engines).

Also of concern to both Washington and New Delhi is the rapid growth of China’s navy. Although China’s military is disproportionately focused on challenges along the nation’s eastern seaboard, especially Taiwan and the South and East China Seas, the rapid modernization and expansion of its fleet enables operations across the Indian Ocean as well. U.S. officials aim to explore cooperative ventures with India that will enable better monitoring of and response to Chinese maritime activities.

Finally, whereas in the past Indian officials jealously perceived U.S. involvement in South Asia as a threat to India’s regional hegemony, now New Delhi is increasingly eager to see Washington play an active economic and political role in neighboring states across the region, such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, as a means to counterbalance Chinese influence."

The three-day visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the United States from June 21 to 23 holds immense significance, not only for the bilateral relations between India and the USA but also for the global geopolitical landscape. This article will delve the importance of the visit, highlight the defence deals signed during the trip, and examine the impact on China as a result of the strengthening of India-US relations.

Significance and Importance of the Visit: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the USA signifies the deepening strategic partnership between the two nations. The trip aimed to strengthen diplomatic ties, enhance cooperation in various sectors, and reinforce the shared democratic values of India and the USA. It served as an opportunity to engage in high-level discussions on crucial global issues such as climate change, economic cooperation, and security challenges.

Defence Deals and Collaborations: During the visit, defence cooperation between India and the USA took centre stage. Several significant defence deals were signed, demonstrating the growing military partnership between the two countries. These deals not only bolster India's defence capabilities but also pave the way for increased defence technology transfers, joint exercises, and information sharing.

a. Defence Procurement: The visit witnessed the signing of defence procurement agreements, including the acquisition of advanced defence equipment from the USA. These procurements are expected to modernize India's defence infrastructure and enhance its defence preparedness. The big deals in the basket are Joint production F414 Jet engine by GE and HAL for Tejas Mark-1 aircraft and the acquisition of 31 MQ-9 Reaper Drones.

b. Technology and Research Collaboration: India and the USA also agreed to strengthen their collaboration in defence technology and research. This would facilitate joint research and development programs, defence innovation initiatives, and technology transfers. Such collaborations are crucial for both countries to address emerging security challenges effectively. The NSA's of both sides had an extensive discussion on the transfer of critical technology to India in New Delhi.

Impact on China: The growing India-US relations have a significant impact on China's geopolitical dynamics. Here are a few key aspects to consider:

a. Balancing China's Influence: The strengthening ties between India and the USA act as a significant counterbalance to China's growing influence in the region. As two major democratic powers, India and the USA aim to maintain a rules-based order, protect freedom of navigation, and promote stability in the Indo-Pacific region. This alignment of interests challenges China's regional ambitions and provides an alternative model of governance.

b. Economic Competition: The deepening India-US partnership poses economic challenges for China. With the focus on trade and investment, India and the USA can enhance their economic integration, reducing their dependence on Chinese markets. This can potentially impact China's economic growth and leverage.

c. Security Concerns: India's close defence cooperation with the USA serves as a deterrent to China's assertive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region. The sharing of intelligence, joint military exercises, and technology transfers enhance India's defence capabilities, making it a formidable force in countering potential threats.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's three-day visit to the USA holds immense significance in the context of India-US relations, defence cooperation, and its impact on China. The visit symbolizes the strengthening of ties between two democratic nations, marked by defence deals, technology collaborations, and shared strategic interests. As India and the USA deepen their partnership, China's regional influence faces challenges, both economically and in terms of security. The evolving dynamics between these nations will continue to shape the geopolitical landscape of the Indo-Pacific region in the years to come."

54,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/21/narenda-modi-washington-dc-biden-white-house-visit-india-china,‘India is now a linchpin’: US looks to Narendra Modi’s visit to counter China,2023-06-21 00:00:00,"The symbolism of the visit will be hard to avoid. As Narendra Modi arrives in Washington DC on Wednesday – the capital of a country he was once prohibited from visiting for almost 10 years – he will join the ranks of Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Volodymyr Zelenskiy as one of the few leaders to address a joint session of Congress more than once.

Statements from US officials ahead of the visit have been rapturous on the subject of US-India relations, praising the “significant defence partnership” and describing it as “a unique connection between the world’s oldest and largest democracies”. Before his departure from India, Modi said: “This special invitation is a reflection of the vigour and vitality of the partnership between our democracies.”

Yet this trip – Modi’s sixth to the US since he came to power in 2014 but the first where a full state dinner will be given in his honour – is expected to yield more than good optics for the Indian prime minister. Many expect it to further crystallise ties between two countries and boost a relationship that has been on an upwards trajectory for two decades – even as they remain fundamentally opposed on several key issues. Defence, technology, security, AI, telecoms, visas, manufacturing and space are all said to be on the table. Meanwhile, the issues of the erosion of democracy in India and the shrinking space for dissent and civil society under Modi are unlikely to be discussed in depth.

Now the world’s most populous country – with 1.4 billion people and rising – and the world’s fifth largest economy, India’s growing prominence, both economically and geopolitically, makes it a country that the Biden administration – like those of Trump, Obama and Bush before it – could not ignore. Yet most experts say that it is China that has been the fundamental driver of this growing alliance; and as Modi touches down in DC, mutual concerns over Beijing’s aggressive, expansionist agenda have never been more acute.

Since Modi last visited the US in 2019, when Donald Trump was in the White House, China’s actions along its 2,100-mile (3,500km) border with India have become increasingly antagonistic. In 2020, the two sides came the closest they had been to war in 70 years when troops clashed along the Himalayan border in Ladakh, killing dozens of soldiers, after Chinese troops encroached on land typically patrolled by India. Since then, China has built up vast amounts of infrastructure along disputed territory and shown little desire to disengage in key areas of contention.

This has coincided with a shift in Washington’s relationship with China, from that of strategic competitor to rival or outright threat that must be deterred and contained. The bipartisan consensus is that India is a crucial geopolitical, and even economic, counterweight to China’s dominance in the Indo-Pacific region.

“In Washington, the hope is to build out an extended framework of deterrence to try and keep China in check,” said Milan Vaishnav, director of the south Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Both geographically as well as strategically and economically, India has become a linchpin in this framework.”

This geopolitical alignment over China – which also drove the formation of the Quad, a security grouping of India, the US, Australia and Japan – has led to an unprecedented flourishing of security and defence cooperation between the US and India. There has been increased intelligence sharing and joint military exercises in the Himalayas close to the China border, and Modi’s US visit is expected to yield several defence deals for surveillance technology and drones.

India has embraced Washington’s new willingness to share its advanced technology and cyber resources, given that its own technological advancements have lagged far behind China’s. Modi will be hoping to close a landmark deal allowing US giant General Electric to produce jet engines in India, to power Indian military aircraft. It will be the first time such a collaboration on military technology has taken place, sending a clear message to China.

While there is little expectation of trade deals between the two countries, trade between India and the US reached a record $191bn in 2022, making the US India’s largest trading partner. There is an interest on both sides in building up India as an economic and manufacturing alternative for big western companies to wean it off its dependency on China – 95% of iPhones are currently made in China, for example, but Apple is slowly shifting manufacturing to India, which is expected to produce 25% of iPhones by 2025.

The limits of a US-India relationship

Yet for all the gushing rhetoric about being “partners of first resort”, experts have also been quick to point out the limitations of the US-India relationship.

Writing in Foreign Affairs, Ashley Tellis, one of the key negotiators for the US nuclear deal with India, warned that even as the Biden administration continued to invest heavily in India, it should not have any “delusions of New Delhi becoming a comrade-in-arms during some future crisis with Beijing”, particularly in terms of India actively taking the US side if China invades Taiwan.

India will never be the kind of ally that the Americans have found in the Anglosphere Avinash Paliwal of the University of London

“India will never be the kind of ally that the Americans have found in the Anglosphere: this is not going to be Australia, Canada or the United Kingdom,” said Avinash Paliwal, an associate professor in international relations at Soas University of London.

“India thinks of itself as a power on its own merit and it has its own geographical compulsions, its own kind of power and its own aspirations on a regional and global scale. There is a meeting of minds and interests at the moment but that’s not something that will last for ever.”

Another issue that looms large over Modi’s visit is that of human rights, in particular the democratic backsliding and the attacks on minorities in India since his populist, Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power. They are allegations that have haunted Modi even before he was prime minister, when his alleged role in the Gujarat riots led to him being banned from the US for a decade.

They have been well documented by the Biden administration. Last year, the state department’s report on international religious freedom documented the challenges to freedom of expression, extrajudicial killings and discrimination against minority groups in Modi’s India, prompting India to call the report “flawed and biased”. More recently, the Commission on International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan agency appointed by Congress, recommended in May that the state department designate India a country of concern for “ongoing and egregious religious freedom violations”.

Before Modi’s visit, Amnesty International called on the US to confront India on the deterioration of human rights and Human Rights Watch organised a screening for US policymakers of a BBC documentary that was critical of Modi, and which was banned in India earlier, as a deliberate reminder of the attacks on freedom of speech under his government.

Yet no US president since Bill Clinton has been forthright on human rights in India, and though the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, did make a rare reference to a rise in “human rights abuses” last year, the Biden administration is expected to continue to keep quiet on any discomfort it may have over Modi’s populist, religious nationalist politics in the name of building strategic security ties. Already several White House officials have made recent references to India’s “vibrant democracy”.

“It’s unlikely to come up, at least in this round of conversations,” said Paliwal. “The Americans are OK doing business with quasi- or undemocratic countries and so I don’t see the democratic decline in India dislocating the glue that is binding the top levels of the two governments or preventing them coming together to deal with the China question.”

Russia, which was briefly a source of contention between India and the US, is also unlikely to be brought up by Biden. India’s historic ties to Russia, which provides almost 80% of its defence and weapons, have ensured that Modi has refused to condemn Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, instead taking a neutral stance, and in the meantime India has become the biggest buyer of cheap Russian oil. While there was initial pushback from Washington, the consensus among analysts is that the Biden administration has now accepted India’s deep-rooted relationship Russia; some believe it has even hastened US cooperation with India on defence to help the country become less dependent on Russia.

But for Modi, this visit can also serve a more personal political purpose. In the US, the Indian diaspora is now one of the largest immigrant groups – second only to Mexicans – and its members occupy influential positions in tech, business, banking and law, and some have even become well-known faces in Hollywood. Emphasising these people-to-people ties, and the vital contributions Indians have made in the US, is also likely to be a prominent part of Modi’s trip.

With India’s next general election less than a year away, the optics of Modi being given full honours by the US president are also likely to play well to the electorate back home. Modi is expected to win a third term in office and his popularity is credited in part to an image among voters that he has made India into a respected player on the world stage and is now courted by powerful western leaders.

“Since independence, India has seen itself as an international power but felt it did not get the recognition or role it deserved,” said Tanvi Madan, director of the India Project at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC. “But Modi seems to believe that endorsements from the US, far from generating a backlash, generate a sense of optimism that this is India’s moment.”"

They may not be quite there yet, but Biden is doing everything to ensure they end up much closer—especially economically and militarily—after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits next week.

Washington is rolling out the red carpet for Modi, hosting him for a state dinner, the Biden administration’s third such visit after welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol within the past year. Modi will also address a joint session of Congress, his second time doing so as Indian prime minister.

It’s not just pomp and symbolism, however. The United States wants to bring India deeper into its manufacturing and defense orbit, with the added benefit of helping wean New Delhi’s military off Russia and U.S. supply chains off China. Although both sides have been tight-lipped on planned announcements, a number of expected agreements on semiconductor chips and fighter jet engines have been in the works for months, bolstered by visits to New Delhi by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in the weeks leading up to Modi’s trip. This week, the two sides reportedly sealed a deal for India to buy more than two dozen American drones.

“While I will not spill the beans, I can tell you that the ceremonial and substantive parts of the visit will fully complement each other and will be unparalleled,” Taranjit Singh Sandhu, India’s ambassador to Washington, said at a recent event.

The India-U.S. relationship hasn’t always been smooth sailing, and potential frictions remain, but the two countries have increasingly zeroed in on an arena where they can achieve symbiosis. “If you ask me what I would bet on the most, what is that one force multiplier for this relationship, it is tech,” Sandhu said. “It is the master key to unlock the real potential in the relationship.”

Officials from both sides have spent months laying the groundwork—and acronyms. An initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET), launched in late January by Sullivan and his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval, commits to cooperation in areas such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, space exploration, semiconductors, and defense technology. There has been more movement on the last two in particular: U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal inked a bilateral semiconductor supply chain partnership in New Delhi in March, while Austin’s visit to New Delhi earlier this month yielded INDUS-X, or the India-U.S. Defense Acceleration Ecosystem, described by the Pentagon as a “new initiative to advance cutting-edge technology cooperation” between the two militaries.

The most significant developments are likely to take place on the defense front, particularly if recent discussions on jointly producing jet engines, long-range artillery, and military vehicles come to fruition next week, product of a yearslong rapprochement on sharing defense technology with India. “This is not just manufacturing in India, this is genuine tech transfer,” said Rudra Chaudhuri, director of New Delhi-based think tank Carnegie India. “That’s a big deal.”

In some ways, it is an opportunity for a marriage of convenience. About half of India’s military equipment is Russian-made, and although New Delhi has spent years trying to diversify that supply, Russia’s protracted war in Ukraine has increased the urgency of finding new bedfellows. Washington sees an opening.

“The one relationship which the U.S. has traditionally been wary of in closer defense ties with India has been the India-Russia partnership,” said Aparna Pande, director of the India Initiative at the Hudson Institute. “This is one chance where if India can be weaned away because of a lack of supply parts, problematic equipment, or Russia getting closer to China, [you can] maybe convince India to purchase more from the United States and U.S. partners and allies.”

China is another major source of mutual concern pushing Washington and New Delhi closer together. India’s relationship with China deteriorated earlier and far more dramatically, with military clashes on their shared border leading to an Indian purge of Chinese technology (including, notably, a TikTok ban) nearly three years ago. Chinese naval expansion into the Indian Ocean has also spooked India and reinforced the importance of the so-called Quad group of countries. The United States and its allies, meanwhile, are urgently trying to reorient and “friendshore” global tech supply chains to reduce dependence on China, which has spent years establishing itself as the world’s factory floor.

India presents a ready replacement in many ways, much of it stemming from its new status as the world’s most populous country. That means a large (and youthful) labor force, millions of whom are skilled engineers, and relatively low manufacturing costs that the Modi government is further bolstering with tax incentives under its signature “Make in India” program. Like China, India’s sheer size also presents a huge potential domestic market for U.S. companies, an advantage over other alternatives such as Vietnam and Mexico. If for decades dollars and cents determined the landscape of global technology production, geopolitics have become supreme.

“There’s a sense of Balkanization taking place” in the global tech supply chain, said Mukesh Aghi, CEO of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a Washington-based business advocacy group. “Geopolitical stress points are driving the tech agenda.”

There are still hurdles that need to be overcome, including India’s history of protectionism and red tape that has burned U.S. companies in the past and made it difficult to create the kind of manufacturing infrastructure required to rival what China has built. One large semiconductor push, a $19 billion joint venture between Indian conglomerate Vedanta and Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, has reportedly already been stymied by a denial of government incentives.

And while companies will ultimately have to vote with their checkbooks, Biden and Modi are sending nothing but boosterish signals.

“Remember the old saying that trade follows the flag—I think the two governments are waving the flag very mightily to show which direction industry and business ought to be going,” said Atul Keshap, a former diplomat who heads the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s U.S.-India Business Council. “The two governments tried for a long time to figure out what government-to-government interaction would look like, and now I think they’re realizing the value of letting the private sector collaborate,” he added.

But one casualty of the Modi visit and his newfound status will likely be U.S. willingness to call out concerns about the health of India’s democracy, at least publicly. The Biden administration has been increasingly reluctant to call out Modi’s crackdowns on free speech and violence against minorities, and experts say the strategic imperatives are too great to afford antagonizing a vital partnership.

“There is a desire to emphasize the strategic and the national security imperative over the domestic imperative,” Pande said. “In the current context, India is important, and so what the U.S. is preferring to do is convey a lot of what it wants to say in private and not in public.”"
57,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/modis-white-house-visit-highlights-deep-diaspora-divides-rcna89275,Modi’s White House visit highlights deep diaspora divides,,"Many South Asian Americans have mixed feelings as they prepare themselves for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to the White House this week.

As some get ready to gather in Washington, D.C., both to welcome and protest him, data from a 2021 study underscores just how torn the diaspora is when it comes to the controversial leader — and it shows that his popularity among Indian Americans falls short of how he is received in India.

This week marks Modi’s first official state visit to the U.S., which had not invited an Indian prime minister since 2009. Modi was once banned from the U.S. for the role he allegedly played in the deadly Gujarat riots, in which 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, were killed.

For many community leaders, a historic moment is severely marred by that and other aspects of Modi’s human rights record, including censoring journalists and stripping autonomy from the region of Kashmir.

“For this kind of a ruler to be invited to a state dinner by an American president and to be given an opportunity to speak to a joint session of Congress, where he’s going to talk about the ideals of democracy, is just mind-boggling,” said Ajit Sahi, the advocacy director for the Indian American Muslim Council.

The study, conducted by the Carnegie Endowment, found that Modi’s approval rating is much lower among Indian Americans (50%) than among Indians living in India (77%). Dozens of lawmakers in both houses of Congress signed a letter urging President Joe Biden to address human rights concerns with Modi during his visit.

“This is an important relationship that we need to continue and build on as it relates to human rights,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a briefing last month.

Sahi said that though Hindu nationalist sentiment in diaspora communities cannot be ignored, he thinks college-educated young people who grew up in the U.S. are distancing themselves from Modi’s politics.

“The American values of liberalism, progressivism, equality for all, justice for all, equality before the law, I think these are the things that more or less get deeply rooted in the psyche, especially if you were born and raised here,” he said.

But the diaspora in the U.S. is still split down the middle in terms of support for Modi. According to the study, 49% of Indian Americans rate his performance favorably, either strongly approving or approving of him; 31% disapprove of his performance; and 20% expressed no opinion on him at all.

“It’s a polarized space,” said Sunita Viswanath, a co-founder of the civil rights group Hindus for Human Rights. “There’s very little scope for bridge-building. ... On the one hand, you have this mainstream Hindu response, which is that India’s national leader is coming to town and is being greeted by the American president with a state dinner, and that puts India on the map.”

On the other hand, those in minority religions and castes oppressed in India say the visit feels as though the U.S. is validating the structural bias their families face, Viswanath said. Many in diaspora spaces say that bias has followed them.

“Inclusive secular democracy means the right for all the different religions to exist and practice freely,” she said. “We are Hindus, we are proud Hindus, but our Hinduism and our devotion to secular democracy, whether it’s in America, where most of us live, or in India, where most of us are from, that is what is motivating us.”

As South Asians in both camps plan to assemble in Washington throughout Modi’s three-day visit, some national organizations are urging Biden to address his recent actions.

The Committee to Protect Journalists issued a statement last week denouncing Modi’s media crackdown and the arrests of journalists since he came to power in 2014.

“Journalists critical of the government and the BJP party have been jailed, harassed, and surveilled in retaliation for their work,” CPJ President Jodie Ginsberg said in the statement. “India is the world’s largest democracy, and it needs to live up to that by ensuring a free and independent media — and we expect the United States to make this a core element of discussions.”

The Hindu American Foundation declined to comment on Modi’s visit. Overseas Friends of the BJP, an international arm of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, did not respond to requests for comment.

The Council on American Islamic Relations released a video and a petition opposing Modi’s visit to address a joint session of Congress on Thursday because of his anti-Muslim, anti-Dalit and anti-Sikh policies.

“The evidence of Modi’s expanding effort to place a boot firmly on the collective heads of India’s religious minorities is extensive,” the petition said.

Though it’s hard to predict how many Indian Americans will gather outside the White House, Modi’s 2019 trip to the U.S. drew over 50,000 to Houston for a rally called “Howdy Modi.” President Donald Trump co-hosted the event, calling it a “profoundly historic event.”

Viswanath remembers the experience four years ago, protesting outside the stadium as fellow Indian Americans poured inside.

“I was holding my sign, and people were streaming into the stadium dressed in their finest,” she said. “They looked like me. They looked like my family. It was one of those moments where I’m grateful I’m on this side of history. … Our deep hope, our ardent hope, is that as we build this space, Hindus will join us.”"

Transcript of Media Briefing by Official Spokesperson in Washington on Prime Minister's visit to USA

April 01, 2016

59,https://www.newsclick.in/us-non-profit-urges-biden-denounce-rights-abuse-during-modi-visit,US Non-Profit Urges Biden to Denounce 'Rights Abuse' During Modi Visit,2023-06-20 14:56:00,"New Delhi: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi left for an official five-day visit to the US on Tuesday, the America-based non-profit advocacy group, Hindus for Human Rights (HRH), has urged President Joe Biden to “engage publicly and meaningfully to push back against the Indian government’s escalating attacks on human rights”.

In a letter signed by 58 organisations and more than 200 individuals and addressed to Biden, HRH urged him to “publicly call on the Indian government to honour its commitments to human rights, including calling on Prime Minister Modi and his Cabinet to halt the use of anti-terror laws to arbitrarily detain political critics”.

HRH supports pluralism and human rights in South Asia and North America and focuses on providing a Hindu voice of resistance to caste, Hindutva, racism, and all forms of bigotry and oppression.

Regarding the ongoing ethnic violence in Manipur, HRH criticised Biden for inviting Modi. “Mr Modi visits DC at a time when the state of Manipur has experienced heavy communal and anti-Christian violence after Modi’s ruling party pushed an initiative to undermine indigenous rights in the state”.

HRH is one of the sponsors of a rally against Prime Minister Modi at the United Nations on Wednesday.

Mentioning “three successive attacks on Indian democracy” the week before the Summit for Democracy, the letter read: “First, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party expelled Rahul Gandhi from Parliament. Second, the Indian government shut the Internet down in Punjab, severely impacting the rights of Sikhs to peacefully organise and protest. And third, the Indian Supreme Court ruled that Indians can be found guilty by association for terrorism.”

While no one from the Biden administration “said anything about even one of these developments, “you invited Prime Minister Modi to speak at the Summit for Democracy” after “Islamophobic violence gripped India in late March”.

The Biden administration has only had private two-way conversations” about the USA and India can always improve when “confronted with questions by Indian reporters about human rights in India”, the group wrote.

“Quite frankly, we find it unacceptable to see such equivocation on Indian democracy from an administration that has been strident in its defence of American democracy and the rule of law.”

The Coalition for Reclaiming Indian Democracy, a coalition of civil rights and interfaith organisations representing Indian-American Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Dalits and allies, will hold two press conferences in Washington DC on Thursday against Biden’s decision to invite Modi and human rights violations in India.

In the first presser, the coalition would strongly oppose the decision of Biden and Congressional leaders to “platform” Modi for a “state dinner and addressing a joint session of Congress”.

The second press conference, titled ‘Beyond the Hype: Highlighting Prime Minister Modi’s Authoritarianism and Human Rights Violations’, will also oppose the decision to invite Modi for a state dinner and addressing a joint session of Congress and highlight human rights abuses in India.

Reclaiming Democracy in India, which highlights the persecution of religious minorities, will organise a fundraiser in New York City on Wednesday about India “moving steadily towards autocracy”.

Alleging that India is one of the “fastest autocratising nations in the world”, the letter read: “Freedom House has rated India as a ‘partly free’ country for the past three years, and has blamed Prime Minister Modi’s government for a rise in discriminatory policies, including persecution against Muslims and caste-based violence against Dalit and Adivasi communities; harassment of civil society, protestors, academia and the media; and the targeting of political opponents.”

Freedom House also rated Kashmir as “not free” citing violations of human, civil and political rights after the Modi government revoked the territory’s autonomous status”, HRH wrote.

Pointing to the 2023 Reporters Without Borders press freedom ranking, HRH wrote: “India has dropped to 161st out of 180 countries in 2023. India has appeared in the Committee to Protect Journalists’ Impunity Index–which examines accountability for unsolved journalists’ murders–every year for the past 15 years, and currently ranks in 11th place worldwide.”

According to the 2022 PEN America’s Freedom to Write Index, “India was one of the top 10 countries that jailed writers globally. The Varieties of Democracy Institute characterises India as an electoral autocracy and blames India’s descent into autocracy on Prime Minister Modi”.

The US Holocaust Memorial Museum has said that “India has been one of the top 15 countries at risk for a mass atrocity event every year since 2017, which reflects the toxicity of Indian politics under Modi”, HRH further wrote.

“As the 2022 Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor report details, several government individuals have committed human rights violations that, under US law, would qualify them to be sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky Act. Indian security forces that have engaged in human rights violations should have security assistance rescinded under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961,” the letter read.

“Given the magnitude of this crisis”, HRH urged the American President to “engage directly with Indian-American and human rights civil society leaders to explore solutions to address India’s human rights crisis”.

“We also ask you to employ the tools at your disposal to ensure that the Indian government cannot attack Indians’ human rights with impunity.”

HRH asked Biden to publicly denounce the “rising numbers of political prisoners and the weaponisation of the rule of law in India to shut down criticism”.

Even if Biden is not “willing to personally criticise” Modi, he has “ample opportunity to criticise the Indian government’s misuse of public trust and public institutions to consolidate power and undermine the will of the Indian people”, HRH wrote.

Reminding Biden of his unique position to lead the fight against authoritarianism, HRH wrote: “Prime Minister Modi will listen to you when you speak. But he and his allies will only change if you take a stand publicly. We urge you to listen to those of us who care about India and ensure that one man cannot steal the futures and the rights of our loved ones in India.”

Council on American-Islamic Relations, Federation of Indian American Christian Organisations, Indian American Muslim Council, International Commission for Dalit Rights, Sikh Coalition and South Asian American Coalition to Renew Democracy are some of the organisations which signed the letter."

Modi's visit to the US will commence in New York, where he will lead the celebrations of the International Day of Yoga at the headquarters of the UN on June 21.

In December 2014, the UN General Assembly had adopted a resolution proclaiming June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.

""The Prime Minister will thereafter travel to Washington D.C., where he will receive a ceremonial welcome at the White House on June 22, and meet President Biden to continue their high-level dialogue. President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden will host a State dinner in honour of the prime minister the same evening,"" the MEA said in a statement.

It said Prime Minister Modi will address a joint sitting of the US Congress on June 22 at the invitation of Congressional leaders, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy and Speaker of the Senate Charles Schumer.

On June 23, the Prime Minister will be jointly hosted at a luncheon by US Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Bilnken, according to the MEA.

""In addition to the official engagements, the Prime Minister is scheduled to have several curated interactions with leading CEOs, professionals, and other stakeholders. He will also meet members of the Indian diaspora,"" it said.

In the second leg of his two-nation visit, Modi will travel to Cairo to pay a state visit to Egypt from June 24 to 25.

The visit is at the invitation of Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, the President of Egypt, which he extended to Modi in January when he graced India's Republic Day celebrations as chief guest.

This will be Modi's first visit to Egypt as Prime Minister .

""Apart from his talks with President Sisi, the prime minister is likely to interact with senior dignitaries from the Egyptian government, some prominent Egyptian personalities, as well as the Indian community in Egypt,"" the MEA said.

""Relations between India and Egypt are based on ancient trade and economic linkages as well as cultural and deep-rooted people-to-people ties,"" it said.

During the state visit of President Sisi to India in January, it was agreed to elevate the relationship between the two countries to a strategic partnership."

President Joe Biden has only twice previously extended such an invitation, the highest-ranking and most prestigious of White House visits, to French President Emmanuel Macron and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, leaders of U.S. treaty allies.

Even the term ""official state visit"" is distinctive. As heads of government, prime ministers are usually invited on an ""official visit"" instead of a ""state visit,"" which is given to heads of state such as monarchs, as well as presidents of countries where he or she is also the head of government.

The White House has not responded to queries about why Modi is given this exception. Protocol-wise, it will be a step up compared to his previous White House visits in 2014, 2016 and 2017, which were a ""working visit,"" ""working lunch,"" and ""official working visit,"" respectively.

In a statement released before he left New Delhi, Modi said Biden’s invitation was a “a reflection of the vigor and vitality of the partnership between our democracies.""

Key partner

For more than two decades, U.S. administrations have treated India as a key partner. Successive American presidents from Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump have made the 15-hour flight to New Delhi.

Trump even campaigned for Modi, heaping praise on the Indian leader in front of tens of thousands of Indian Americans at a ""Howdy, Modi!"" 2019 rally in Texas. Modi reciprocated by hosting the ""Namaste Trump"" 2020 event where Trump was cheered on by a crowd of more than 100,000 in Ahmedabad, Modi's political homeland.

But no American president has granted Modi what Biden will this week — maximum display of White House respect and hospitality, including a full honor guard arrival and departure ceremony, lavish dinner reception and accommodation at Blair House, the official guest house located across the street from the White House.

It will be the same full-on pomp that Obama rolled out in 2009 for Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

Modi also will be invited to speak to a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday, his second time speaking to American lawmakers following his speech in 2016. His predecessors, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Singh, delivered addresses in 2000 and 2005.

Geostrategic interests

Biden has at least two reasons to roll out the red carpet for Modi: to bolster India's role in the region to counterbalance China and to wean it off Russian arms.

India is the only country that has engaged in open conflict with China in the past decades. From Washington's perspective, a robust partnership with New Delhi is critical to realizing the U.S. vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, said Ely Ratner, assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, at a recent event at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank working on defense and national security policies.

""A stronger India that can defend its own interest, and its sovereignty is good for the United States,"" he said.

Modi said India and the U.S. are collaborating to further “shared vision of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.” Local media have reported that during his visit, Modi will sign a $3 billion deal to purchase more than two dozen armed Predator drones for surveillance along India's border with China and Pakistan.

Another potential deliverable — a technology transfer by American company General Electric for state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to produce engines for Tejas military fighter jets at its facility in Bengaluru.

Critical and emerging technologies

In an effort to diversify supply chain away from China, the administration announced the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) with India last year.

As part of iCET, earlier this month during National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan’s visit to New Delhi, India and the U.S. unveiled a road map for enhanced collaboration in high-technology areas, with a focus on addressing regulatory barriers and aligning export controls for smoother trade and “deeper cooperation” in critical areas.

""India is also seeking sensitive, critical and emerging technologies that the U.S. is often loath to share,"" said Donald Camp, chair in U.S.-India policy studies at the Center of Strategic and International Studies during a recent briefing at the nonprofit research organization. ""So, they will be talking about cooperation in artificial intelligence and quantum computing.""

Micron Technology Inc. is reportedly close to committing at least $1 billion toward setting up a semiconductor packaging plant in India — a deal blessed by the administration as it seeks to diversify the supply chain of chips away from China.

Tensions with China and Pakistan have long driven India to become the world's largest arms importer. From 2018 to 2022, it purchased 11% of the world's weapons, almost half of it from Russia, according to the international arms transfer report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

It's one of the reasons why India has been reluctant to condemn Moscow's invasion, said Aparna Pande, director of the Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia at the Hudson Institute.

The war on Ukraine, she told VOA, has provided the Biden administration a ""once in a lifetime opportunity"" to wean India away from its dependence on Moscow. ""Because the equipment is not as easily available, spare parts are not coming through, and it's not really performing that well.""

Russia was also the largest supplier of arms to India from 2013 to 2017, accounting for 64% of total Indian arms imports. It fell to 45% during the period from 2018 to 2022 due to increased domestic Indian arms production, and since 2022, constraints related to its invasion of Ukraine.

Global South

This year, India holds the presidency of the G20, a group of 20 developing and developed economies, including the G7, the world's seven richest democracies. It will host the G20 summit later this year, with an agenda heavy on the interests of the so-called Global South, shorthand for low- and middle-income countries.

Biden is expected to consult with Modi on the G7's outreach to the Global South, which is partly based on concerns about China's heavy footprint across the developing world, which is creating unsustainable levels of infrastructure debt in some countries, as well as Beijing's clout over supply chains and critical minerals.

A proposal is being pushed by Modi to give the African Union permanent membership at the G20. The move could be strategic to regain ground lost to China and Russia — countries that have taken a head start in forging relations with the group's 55-member nations, Beijing with its infrastructure loans and Moscow with its arms export.

Modi will also likely discuss with Biden the awkward task of finalizing the G20 guest list — whether to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country is a member. Amid threats of G7 leaders' boycott, last year's G20 president, Indonesia, navigated the diplomatic headache by convincing Putin to send his foreign minister and inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to attend virtually as an observer."

63,https://www.indianeagle.com/travelbeats/modi-first-state-visit-usa/,PM Modi’s Flying Fortress is Set for His First State Visit to USA; Full Schedule,2023-06-17 20:48:14+00:00,"Indian VVIPs’ flying fortress, Air India One B777 which got a Rs-8400cr makeover in 2020, is getting ready for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s sixth trip but first state visit to the United States. Scheduled from 21 to 24 June 2023, PM Modi is visiting the US at the invitation of President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. India’s former President S Radhakrishnan and former PM Manmohan Singh were Modiji’s predecessors to have been bestowed the honor of an official visit to America in 1963 and 2009 respectively.

PM Modi’s official US visit in 2023 is highly anticipated to create history, as he will be addressing a joint meeting of the US Congress at the Capitol on June 23. This is one of the most prestigious honors that White House accords to the political heads of foreign countries in good relations with America. The Indian American community and corporate honchos of the US, including CEOs of top conglomerates are gearing up to welcome him. The stupendous success of the “Howdy Modi!” event in Houston, which the Indian-origin leaders of Texas had organized during Modi’s trip in 2019, is a litmus taste to his popularity overseas.

The schedule of Modi’s first state visit to USA is full of events starting with the International Yoga Day celebration at the UN headquarters in New York City on June 21. On the same day, he would fly to Washington DC, where his stay will be arranged at Blair House. Adjudged as “the world’s most exclusive hotel”, Blair House is the US President’s guest house for visiting foreign dignitaries. He would be treated as an honorable state guest there.

June 21 will end with a private dinner that the Bidens will host at the White House in honor of PM Modi, following an event with Dr. Jill Biden, an advocate of educational opportunities. The pre-dinner event is likely to culminate in a discussion on the prospects of creating a bridge between US universities and the top institutes in India. On June 22, Modi will be given a grand welcome at the South Lawns of the White House, according to his US visit 2023 schedule. Reportedly, thousands of Indian American leaders from different walks of life would attend the welcome ceremony.

PM Modi’s first official visit to Washington DC is being hailed as a milestone in the US-India relationship. The President of the world’s biggest economy and the Prime Minister of the world’s largest democracy will have a one-on-one talk in the Oval Office where a ceremonial lamp is lit to celebrate Diwali every year. It will be followed by a delegation-level meeting at the Capitol where Modi will address the joint session of the US Congress in the afternoon of June 22.

In the evening, PM Modi will be treated to the state dinner at the White House. Over 250 delegates, including the crème de la crème of the diverse Indian American community, will join him at dinner. The state guest and the delegates in attendance will get to see some cultural programs reflecting the beauty of India.

A lavish luncheon with Vice president Kamala Harris and the Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also on the schedule of Modi’s 2023 trip to USA. The luncheon will be arranged in the Benjamin Franklin Room of the State Department on June 23. In addition to diplomatic discussions with the leaders in President Biden’s cabinet, Modi will honor invitations by Indian Diaspora in America. Leading diaspora groups, such as Indiaspora, will host him at Ronald Regan Center in Washington DC on June 23. The program is named “We The People: Celebrating the US-India Partnership”. Another diaspora gathering is likely to be organized at John F. Kennedy Center by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF).

“Political mavericks of the US are looking forward to Indian PM Modi’s address to a joint session of the Congress at the Capitol. They are expecting to hear Modi about India’s neutral stance on the Russian-Ukraine conflict, and India’s denial of United Airlines’ application for regulatory approvals to codeshare with Emirates flights to and from India. It is also anticipated that Indian-origin leaders from Texas, California, Seattle, Atlanta, Florida, and Michigan would petition to PM Modi for nonstop flights to India, which they had done before,” said Sourav Agarwal, the Editor of Travel Beats, a leading portal for Indian Diaspora by Indian Eagle Travel.

The excitement about PM Modi’s visit is so high in Indian Diaspora that Shripad Kulkarni, the chef of a New Jersey Indian restaurant named Mehek, has launched a special ‘Modi Ji Thali’ in his honor."

The 75th session of the UNGA in 2020 was washed out by the Covid pandemic. This year, though, the 76th UNGA afforded a chance for assorted leaders — Prime Ministers, Presidents, Emirs, Sheikhs — and assorted rulers to descend on America, to be seen, photographed, heard and video-taped, and to meet, if they could get an audience, with the new White House team of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

For India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was a much awaited and long anticipated return to some semblance of a pre-Covid level frenetic globe-trotting, sans the tight embrace, bon-homie style that led to the term “hugplomacy”.

But how did it go for Team Modi?

Well, on the face of it, it is hard to see how it could have been anything other than a success given that the official press release that contained the PMO’s own statement before the trip made it clear that expectations were modest. It was to “review” the strategic partnership, “exchange” views with the US leadership, “take stock” with QUAD partners, “consolidate” relations with partners, and “address” the UN. In short, it was all a pro-forma process with no pre-defined outcomes.

The media reactions to the visit and its aftermath followed the usual playbook. Republic TV made it sound like Modi was the only foreign dignitary to speak at the UNGA. Zee News ran with silly stories of “Josh high in Washington,” and breathless accounts of a grand welcome home. Aaj Tak was keen to emphasise how this trip had many firsts. Times Now presented it as a pivotal geopolitical moment .

If these were the only news channels you watched you’d think this was it — the grand State Visit that was going to solve every world problem from climate change to China to poverty to international conflict.

But how did other players respond? And how did the media, especially sections of social media, view it all?

Even as the Indian Prime Minister’s brand new 4,500 Crore Rupees Air India One Boeing was taking off from Delhi, the voices of human rights and religious freedoms were telling the US President’s team the issues he should take up with his Indian counterpart. On 22 September in a 90-minute webinar , under the “Congressional briefings” banner chaired by John Prabhudoss (from the Federation of Indian American Christian Organisations ), a call went out to the the White House and leaders of the US Congress to take the opportunity of the visit by Prime Minister Modi to impress upon him the need for the Indian Government to take urgent steps to protect human and civil rights and promote religious freedoms.

At the webinar, Nadine Maenza, Chair of the US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), reminded the audience of the recommendation of the Commission in two annual reports to the US State Department to regard India as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) in relation to religious freedoms. She referred her audience to Prof Angana Chatterji’s report on the situation in Assam, entitled “BREAKING WORLDS: Religion, Law and Citizenship in Majoritarian India: The Story of Assam” — a report dated September 2, which was almost prescient in light of recent events in that troubled State.

Govind Acharya of Amnesty International USA, Angna Chatterji of UC Berkeley, and Harsh Mander , currently a Fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy, and John Sifton, Asia Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch (a copy of his testimony is here ) also spoke in the webinar.

The broad but pointed message of this panel to the US team was that it was incumbent upon the Biden White House to impress upon the Indian side that a strong and stable strategic partnership can only be sustained by respect for human rights; space for the democratic values of free speech, press freedoms, and the rule of law; and the promotion of religious freedoms of minorities.

The leader of the Farmers protest, Rakesh Tikait tweeted an “open letter” to President Biden to intercede with his Indian counterpart on behalf of the agitating farmers.

The meeting at the White House with Vice-President Kamala Harris invited social media attention for the VP’s pointed mention of the importance of democratic values in both countries.

“As democracies around the world are under threat, it is imperative that we defend democratic principles and institutions within our countries. We must strengthen democracy at home and it is incumbent upon us that we protect democracy in the best interest of our people,” she said. Note that the Biden-Harris White House took charge at a particularly traumatic time because of the attempted insurrection and the dramatically violent assault on the very heart of US democracy.

The Prime Minister's meeting with President Joe Biden was a relatively tame affair with the President jocularly praising , almost tongue-in-cheek, the Indian journalists for being “well-behaved”.

Some things do not change. Even in 2019, PM Modi’s visit was presented as a major world event and a huge success but only by the Indian media for their audience back home, but it barely registered as a footnote in the US media. Then too, as Shoaib Danyal put it , “jingoism took precedence over factual reporting about the UN session”. There was barely a mention of the Modi visit in the US media save a brief mention in the context of the QUAD meeting, much to the surprise of Aaj Tak anchor Anjana Om Kashyap who tried flicking through a selection of US papers on air to spot coverage of the Modi visit.

Indeed very few Indian media outlets, if any at all, took the trouble to research what the 76th UNGA was about, and what the stand was of the other world leaders who also addressed the General Assembly. A cursory search on Google would have led even a rookie journalist to a wealth of information about the agenda, background papers, and issues before the UN.

Instead they focused exclusively and breathlessly on the 20-minute long address by PM Modi on September 25. The speech itself was as might have been expected. It sounded like a robust and combative defense of the Indian Government’s record in office in the last seven years; set against a backdrop of statements about India as an ancient democratic civilisation that inherently valued diversity, individual freedom, development, trade, openness and peace.

There was the obligatory reference to terrorism, of course, and how a certain neighbour sought to rely on terrorism rather than development to further its political aims.

Speaking in Hindi with instantaneous translation by the UN team into several languages, Modi’s speech at the UN was not the eagerly anticipated address that Indian media channels would have you believe. It was left to social media and Twitter handles to point out the preponderance of vacant seats in the assembly Hall

In the final analysis, it depends very much on the newspaper you read or the TV news you watch to get a feel for how important or influential the Indian PM’s visit to the US was. Perhaps, the truth is somewhere between the breathless fawning coverage of the TV channels that are beholden to the Government for its largesse and the somewhat cynical view expressed in this tweet thread.

Such visits by the head of the country’s government to gatherings of major world leaders are important and necessary, even if not essential — because not to make the effort to travel and be seen would be an own goal. But part of the magic is to manage expectations, say the right things at the right time, but to do so in an understated manner that does not make the audience cynical. But perhaps the most important thing is to be accessible to the world’s press.

This visit to the United States was the 6th by Mr Modi. And while there were many ‘firsts’ that his supporters claimed for it, regrettably it was not the first foreign trip in which the Indian Prime Minister gave a press conference."
65,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/india/markey-modi-biden-united-states,India as It Is,2023-06-16 00:00:00-04:00,"It has been a ritual for decades. Whenever American policymakers travel to India, they sing paeans to the beauty of Indian politics, to the country’s diversity, and to the shared values connecting—in the words of multiple U.S. presidents—“the world’s oldest democracy” and “the world’s largest democracy.” This rhetoric may be gauzy, and it is certainly grandiose. But to Washington, it is not empty. In the view of U.S. policymakers, common democratic principles will be the foundation of an enduring U.S.-Indian relationship, one with broad strategic significance. The world’s two biggest democracies, they say, can’t help but have similar worldviews and interests.

“Our common interest in democracy and righteousness will enable your countrymen and mine to make common cause against a common enemy,” U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt wrote to Mohandas Gandhi, then the de facto leader of India’s independence movement, during World War II. During the Cold War, successive presidential administrations tried to get New Delhi to stand against Moscow by arguing that, as a democracy, India was a natural enemy of the Soviet Union. When President George W. Bush struck a breakthrough civilian nuclear deal with India in 2005, he declared that India’s democratic system meant that the two states were “natural partners” united “by deeply held values.”

Yet again and again, India has disappointed American hopes. Gandhi, for example, frustrated Roosevelt by prioritizing India’s struggle for freedom against the British Empire over the war against imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. New Delhi not only refused to align with Washington during the Cold War; it forged warm ties with Moscow instead. Even after the Cold War ended and India began strengthening its relations with the United States, New Delhi maintained strong connections to the Kremlin. It has refused to work with the United States on Iran, and it has made nice with Myanmar’s military regime. Most recently, it has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

If making democratic values the cornerstone of the U.S.-Indian relationship has always been a dubious strategy, today it is clearly doomed—because the very notion of common values has itself come to look fanciful. Ever since Narendra Modi became the Indian prime minister nine years ago, India’s status as a democracy has become increasingly suspect. The “world’s largest democracy” has seen an upsurge in violence directed at its Muslim minority, often whipped up by prominent politicians. It is trying to strip citizenship from millions of Muslim residents. It is muzzling the press and silencing opposition figures. The Biden administration, having cast itself as a vocal champion of democratic ideals, therefore finds itself on shaky ground whenever it characterizes the United States’ partnership with India as one of shared values.

But it continues to do just that. In January, for example, the White House declared that the two states’ joint technology initiatives were “shaped by our shared democratic values and respect for universal human rights.” In June, Modi will visit Washington, D.C., for a formal state dinner meant to affirm “the warm bonds of family and friendship” that link the two countries. In February, however, the Indian government made it difficult for a leading Indian think tank to raise money, a major blow to intellectual freedom. In March, Modi’s party removed one of India’s most prominent opposition politicians from Parliament—explicitly because he insulted the prime minister.

Yet even as the two countries’ shared values have grown weaker, their shared material interests have only gotten stronger. India and the United States now have a clear, common geopolitical foe in China, and each understands that the other can help it win its competition against Beijing. For the United States, India is a massive, pivotal power in Asia that sits astride critical maritime routes and shares a long, contested land border with China. For India, the United States is an attractive source of advanced technology, education, and investment. New Delhi may still have close ties with Moscow, but the uncertain quality and reliability of Russian arms mean that India is more open than ever to buying weapons from the West instead.

To capitalize on these complementary material interests, however, the United States must dispense with the idea that shared values can provide the bedrock of a strong relationship, justifying its high tolerance for New Delhi’s behavior on the basis of a bet on long-term convergence. Rather than considering India an ally in the fight for global democracy, it must see that India is an ally of convenience. This shift will not be easy, given that Washington has spent decades looking at New Delhi through rose-colored glasses. But the pivot will encourage both sides to understand that their relationship is ultimately transactional—and allow them to get down to business.

BAD BETS

American leaders, especially liberal ones, have long believed that democratic institutions are a defining feature of India’s identity—and the reason why New Delhi deserves Washington’s support. In 1958, for example, then Senator John Kennedy introduced a bipartisan resolution to increase assistance to India, premised on the idea that it was vital for the United States to support a fledgling democracy against communist encroachment. India’s “democratic future is delicately and dangerously poised,” Kennedy declared in a landmark speech. “It would be catastrophic if its leadership were now humiliated in its quest for Western assistance when its cause is good.”

As the former diplomat Dennis Kux wrote in India and the United States: Estranged Democracies, “The effort succeeded.” During President Dwight Eisenhower’s second term, Kux notes, “US assistance grew substantially, surging from about $400 million in 1957, to a record $822 million in 1960.” Eisenhower himself seemed committed to India’s democratic future. As the president stated in remarks at the opening of the World Agriculture Fair in New Delhi in December 1959, “Whatever strengthens India, my people are convinced, strengthens us, a sister republic dedicated to peace.” Six months later, Eisenhower signed a breakthrough multiyear deal with India to deliver $1.28 billion in food aid under the United States’ Food for Peace program, because India’s domestic farmers were routinely unable to meet the country’s food needs.

But if Kennedy and Eisenhower hoped that praising India would turn New Delhi into an ally, they were sorely mistaken. In 1954, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had explicitly declared that his country would remain nonaligned in the Cold War, rankling Eisenhower. Kennedy, as president, hoped he could bring India closer by having Nehru visit Washington in 1961, but the trip changed nothing. The prime minister rebuffed all his efforts to bring India into the United States’ orbit.

As Kux recounts, Kennedy’s Cold War successors were similarly frustrated by New Delhi. President Lyndon Johnson found Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s 1966 criticism of U.S. involvement in Vietnam to be particularly galling; his ambassador to India later recalled that the president’s reaction ranged “from the violent to the obscene.” Gandhi’s subsequent decision, in 1971, to conclude a “Friendship Treaty” with Moscow was later described by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as a “bombshell” that threw “a lighted match into a powder keg,” inflaming relations between India and Pakistan. And in January 1980, when India’s permanent ambassador to the United Nations effectively endorsed the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan, President Jimmy Carter was livid. Carter’s ambassador in New Delhi told Gandhi “what a devastating statement it had been from the American point of view and what a terrible backlash it had caused in the United States.”

Nonetheless, U.S. policymakers often praised India in the following decades, and policymakers continued to argue that India’s democratic principles made it a good partner. In his address to India’s Parliament in 2000, President Bill Clinton asserted that the strength of India’s democracy was the first of several important lessons it had taught the world. The administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama routinely employed the “oldest and largest democracies” formulation to describe Washington and New Delhi and their longtime ties. In a 2010 speech to the Indian Parliament, Obama repeatedly stressed the unique bond shared by “two strong democracies.” He then endorsed India’s effort to obtain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, suggesting that cooperation between India and the United States on the council would strengthen “the foundations of democratic governance, not only at home but abroad.”

Obama’s Security Council reform has yet to materialize, but it is difficult to see how India’s performance at the UN would ever live up to U.S. expectations. In the UN General Assembly from 2014 to 2019, only 20 percent of India’s votes were coincident with those of the United States. Even when votes on Israeli and Palestinian issues (on which the two states are even further apart) are excluded, the figure rises to only 24 percent. By comparison, France voted with the United States 57 percent of the time overall and 67 percent of the time when Israeli and Palestinian issues were left out. This divergence shouldn’t be surprising; India has routinely walked away from the United States’ biggest international initiatives. It has never joined a Washington-led trade agreement, for example. And it has never given much more than lip service to Washington’s drives to expand democracy, whether in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, during the Bush administration’s efforts to promote the so-called freedom agenda, or during the Arab Spring of the Obama years.

Hindu nationalism at home leads India to promote illiberal aims abroad.

Despite these disappointments, the Biden administration has continued to push for closer ties with India, leaning hard into the two states’ supposedly common values as it makes its case. President Joe Biden invited Modi to Washington’s two democracy summits, and the prime minister delivered remarks at each. In a May 2022 meeting with Modi, Biden said that cooperation between India and the United States is built on their shared “commitment to representative democracy.” When Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited India in July 2021, he said that “the relationship between our two countries is so important and so strong because it is a relationship between our democracies.” And on a March 2023 trip to New Delhi, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo praised Modi as an “unbelievable visionary” and declared that the two states were united by democratic principles.

But yet again, New Delhi has frustrated the White House on policies related to liberal values. It has, for instance, maintained ties with and sold weapons to the military junta that ousted Myanmar’s democratic government in 2021. New Delhi plays an active role in multilateral groups critical of the United States and the West, such as the BRICS, which also includes Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa. And it has continued to stand by Moscow. Shortly before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, India went ahead with purchases of Russian S-400 air defense systems, despite the threat of U.S. sanctions. Since the invasion, India has abstained on every decisive UN vote. It has refused to entertain any economic restrictions against Russia. It even began purchasing more Russian energy after the invasion began.

India’s behavior regarding the war in Ukraine, in particular, has angered many of New Delhi’s biggest supporters in the U.S. Congress. “Frankly, many of my colleagues and I are puzzled by India’s equivocation in the face of the biggest threat to democracy since World War II,” said Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who chairs the Senate subcommittee responsible for South Asia. “At a time when democracies are closing ranks to condemn Russia’s invasion, it is troubling, to say the least, to see India, the world’s largest democracy, sitting on the sidelines.”

AUTOCRACY PROMOTION

New Delhi’s position on Ukraine certainly cuts against its espoused values. But it is far from India’s biggest democratic failure. Since winning two sweeping national victories, one in 2014 and another in 2019, Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party has made India’s own attachment to liberalism more and more dubious. The BJP has hollowed out institutions that can check the prime minister’s behavior, including by politicizing India’s civilian bureaucracy and turning its Parliament into a rubber stamp for the party’s priorities. Modi also tolerates no criticism in the media, academia, or civil society. The government, for example, imposed an outright ban on a 2023 BBC documentary that detailed Modi’s role in the state of Gujarat’s deadly 2002 communal riots. The organizations that compile the three biggest rankings of democracy across the world—the V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) Institute, Freedom House, and the Economist Intelligence Unit—have all downgraded India’s score since Modi took office.

New Delhi’s democratic failings extend beyond eliminating checks and balances. The BJP is deeply intertwined with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, an organization that aims to give India an exclusively Hindu identity (and to which Modi belongs). Created in 1925, the RSS was modeled on interwar European fascist groups and charged with promoting, in the words of one founder, “the military regeneration of the Hindus.” This goal was directly opposed by Mohandas Gandhi and Nehru, who championed freedom of religion, celebrated diversity, and defended minority rights. That is why a radicalized Hindu nationalist and RSS member assassinated Gandhi in 1948.

India’s autocratic turn creates many problems for the United States. One is that it simply makes New Delhi less trustworthy. Democratically accountable leaders need to justify and defend foreign policies to their own citizens, which makes their decisions more transparent and predictable. Authoritarian decisions, by contrast, are far harder to predict. In addition, the more ethnonationalist New Delhi becomes, the less secure India will be. India is home to roughly 200 million Muslims—almost the size of Pakistan’s entire population—and it has an extensive history of communal violence. By repressing its minorities, India risks its tenuous stability in the near term and mounting and debilitating violence in the long term. And an India consumed with internal security challenges will have fewer resources, less bandwidth for foreign policy, and less legitimacy to play a constructive role beyond its borders.

India’s Hindu nationalism at home also leads it to promote illiberal aims abroad. Hindu nationalists believe that one of their top foreign policy achievements has been mobilizing overseas RSS-affiliated groups in the Indian diaspora to lobby other capitals, including Washington, to support BJP initiatives. Hindu nationalists also believe that India should be a sprawling, civilizational power, and many of them say they want to create Akhand Bharat—a greater “Undivided India”—in which New Delhi would build a “cultural confederation” of territory stretching from Afghanistan to Myanmar and Sri Lanka to Tibet. In 2022, for example, the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat claimed that this could be a reality in as little as ten to 15 years. His statements raised questions about what a Hindu cultural confederation would actually mean, and they have prompted at least some regional consternation about whether India’s drive for leadership will be as peaceful as the country claims.

Despite the obvious evidence of the BJP’s illiberalism, top Biden administration officials have avoided publicly criticizing the Modi government. Instead, they have brushed aside concerns by declaring, as Blinken did in 2021, that every democracy is an imperfect “work in progress.” Presumably, that is because Biden believes that expressing any concerns about Indian policies would cause too much harm to the relationship.

This fear is not baseless. Like most countries, India does not like to be criticized, so an honest airing of grievances would not go down well. But the current, disingenuous approach has its own price. Soft-pedaling concerns about India’s authoritarian slide, for example, weakens Washington’s ability to champion democracy around the world. In fact, it might actively encourage democratic backsliding. India is no garden-variety struggling democracy: it is the world’s most populous country and a leader in the global South. When Modi uses his association with Washington to burnish his democratic credentials and even to strengthen his self-serving narrative that Hindu India is “the mother of democracy” (as he declared during Washington’s 2023 Summit for Democracy), it sets back liberalism everywhere.

Praising India’s democracy also makes it hard for Biden to build the domestic political alliances he needs to cooperate with New Delhi on security. Many powerful U.S. constituencies, including evangelical Christian groups, are deeply concerned about India’s poor treatment of minorities, its crackdown on religious freedoms, and its stifling of the press. The New York Times and The Washington Post, along with other top U.S. media outlets, run stories and columns on these issues so frequently that BJP leaders have gone out of their way to label the publications “anti-Indian.” And influential figures in Washington are expressing growing alarm about India’s illiberal policies. In March 2021, for example, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Menendez wrote a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, asking that he use his upcoming India trip to “make clear that in all areas, including security cooperation, the U.S.-India partnership must rest on adherence to democratic values.” If Biden continues to emphasize principles in his pitch for better relations, his calls could face mounting opposition.

ENEMY OF MY ENEMY

India’s turn away from democracy is deeply unfortunate. But New Delhi is still an invaluable partner for Washington. In addition to being the world’s most populous state, India boasts the world’s fifth-largest economy, the world’s second-largest military, and a significant cadre of highly educated scientists and engineers. It has a large arsenal of nuclear weapons. And like the United States, India is deeply concerned about China, which it sees as a dangerous power intent on challenging the regional and global order. In a way, now may be the best moment for the United States to cooperate with India. The question is how far Washington should go.

In many cases, the decision to help India is easy. When China began encroaching on Indian territory along the Chinese-Indian border, prompting deadly clashes between the two countries’ militaries in 2020, Washington rightfully provided New Delhi with urgently needed cold-weather gear and intelligence on Chinese positions. It also expedited already planned deliveries of surveillance drones. Since then, U.S. officials have correctly concluded that they can have far more candid discussions with India’s leaders than they have had in the past about defense cooperation, both on land and at sea. They hope that the threat from China, combined with Russia’s disastrous invasion of Ukraine, presents Washington with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to decisively (if not immediately) get New Delhi to shift its heavy reliance on Russian-made military gear to U.S. systems.

Greater U.S.-Indian alignment on China also means the two states could cooperate on certain kinds of technology. Washington, for example, could work with New Delhi to develop alternatives to Chinese-built information and telecommunications infrastructure as a means to compete in a global industry that Beijing has threatened to dominate. The United States could also speed up its efforts to diversify essential industrial inputs away from China and toward India. New Delhi, in turn, would benefit from new economic investments.

U.S. cooperation with India must be tightly targeted to countering China.

But Washington must be careful about the ways it deals with New Delhi. It must remain keenly aware that India’s desire to work with the United States is born of circumstance, not conviction, and could quickly disappear. New Delhi, after all, spent most of the post–Cold War years vacillating about what role it should play between Beijing and Washington, and it often signed on to the former’s initiatives. Even after the border clashes, China and India have roughly the same volume of trade as India and the United States have. New Delhi is still part of the Beijing-founded Shanghai Cooperation Organization. And many Indian policymakers and analysts would much prefer a multipolar world in which India is free to navigate flexible relationships with other great powers to a world led by the United States or defined by a new cold war between Beijing and Washington—a world in which New Delhi must take sides. One of New Delhi’s greatest fears is being indefinitely consigned to the geopolitical sidelines.

For U.S. officials, then, cooperation with India must be tightly targeted to countering immediate threats posed by China. It is fine, for example, for the United States to conduct joint military exercises with India near the Chinese border, as the two states did in November 2022. It is also fine for Washington to strike transactional deals that obviously advance U.S. interests, such as a deal that gives the United States access to Indian seaports in exchange for finite technology transfers or additional intelligence. But when U.S. policies do not clearly enhance U.S.-Indian cooperation with respect to China, they should not receive the benefit of the doubt. The United States should think twice, for example, before approving a proposal General Electric put forward earlier this year to co-produce and transfer U.S. technology to India for advanced fighter jet engines. Washington may benefit from a better Indian military in the short term, but the GE deal could strengthen India’s indigenous defense industry for decades, which might not serve U.S. interests in the long term.

U.S. officials must understand that, deep down, India is not an ally. Its relationship to the United States is fundamentally unlike that of, say, a NATO member. And India will never aspire to that sort of alliance. For this reason, U.S. officials should not frame their agreements with India as the building blocks of a deeper relationship. The country is not a candidate for initiatives such as the AUKUS deal among Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (which will help Australia develop nuclear submarine technologies) because such deals entail sharing important security vulnerabilities that only sturdy liberal democracies—ones with broadly shared values and aspirations—can safely exchange. India’s uncertain commitment to democratic principles is also why Washington will never be able to share intelligence with New Delhi in the way that it does with its so-called Five Eyes partners: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

In fact, Washington should qualify its support for greater Indian participation in the international organizations to which New Delhi already belongs. India’s voice is essential on the world stage, especially because of its vast and diverse society. But considering how often India and the United States diverge on important issues, it is not a bad thing that no one has taken up Obama’s proposal to offer India a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Washington should similarly temper its expectations for the Quad—the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, among Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. The White House clearly hopes that the Quad can be an Indo-Pacific league of liberal democracies. But given India’s identity, it simply cannot. What the Quad can do is better deter Chinese aggression in the region, and it should dedicate itself to that task.

TRUTH BE TOLD

As the Biden administration pivots away from seeking an imaginary relationship based on values to acknowledging a real one based on mutual interests, it must be forthright. The administration ought to explain to Indian and U.S. audiences alike that shared concerns about China and a wide array of other common interests create strong and constructive incentives for cooperation; there is much that the two sides can do together. But Washington needs to cease endorsing Modi’s BJP. It must stop altruistically subsidizing the rise of another illiberal Asian giant. And the Indian government should know that its domestic political decisions have the potential to complicate and endanger relations with Washington. Indian voters should know that, too.

The Biden administration should also write and publish more reports that accurately depict India’s record on human rights, freedoms, and democratic practices. Such analysis should then become required reading for U.S. leaders, including Pentagon policymakers and uniformed officers, who need to understand how undemocratic the world’s largest democracy is. These reports must be scrupulously accurate, because they will certainly draw fire from Indian diplomats. But Biden should not worry that U.S. criticism will derail cooperation. Unlike Chinese military activities, a critical report from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom does not materially threaten New Delhi. If India and the United States are going to be strong partners, both sides need to learn how to navigate serious disagreements without sweeping them under the rug, even if that means suffering some unpleasantness along the way. U.S. officials can unapologetically explain the American perspective without being undiplomatic, just as their Indian counterparts frequently do.

Many U.S. opponents of the Modi government would go even further, arguing that criticism of India’s democratic shortcomings should be bolstered by active U.S. government initiatives—such as giving material support to Indian rights groups. Some critics have even encouraged Washington to withhold U.S. security cooperation unless India rolls back recent autocratic measures. But New Delhi is likely to balk at conditional defense ties, and pro-democracy investments will not be effective. India is almost unimaginably enormous and complicated, making it nearly impervious to outside political influence. As a postcolonial state, it is quite practiced at resisting, ignoring, or mitigating external interference. Better, then, to leave the task of strengthening India’s democracy to the Indians themselves.

U.S. officials must understand that, deep down, India is not an ally.

For now, that means the United States will have to deal with an unsavory government in New Delhi. But for Washington, this is nothing new. The United States has spent years cooperating with regimes it dislikes in order to bolster its security. At one point, it even worked with the country New Delhi and Washington are now trying to outcompete. The Nixon administration’s 1972 opening to China was intended to exploit the differences between Beijing and Moscow to deliver a decisive advantage to the United States in the Cold War. It succeeded: President Richard Nixon’s gambit deepened splits in the global communist movement, helped tie down Soviet army divisions along the border with China, and provided Washington with additional leverage over Moscow.

What followed, however, is much more controversial. Nixon’s opening eventually led to a deluge of U.S. investment in China’s economy and cooperation across many sectors—including, at times, defense and security. The United States’ contributions helped China quickly become the world’s second-largest economy. Washington instead should have had a greater appreciation for the ways in which U.S. and Chinese interests would most likely diverge as China’s power grew. American policymakers could have then lowered their expectations, narrowed the scope of official cooperation, and even ruled out certain types of commerce. In hindsight, it is clear they could have partnered with Beijing to contain Moscow without contributing so much to the rise of a peer competitor.

India, of course, is not China, and it may never pose the same sort of challenge. And New Delhi’s authoritarian turn has not been total. Despite the government’s best efforts, India still has free (if not fair) elections and a vocal domestic opposition. Americans and Indians can, and should, hold out hope that India’s diverse society will remake India into a liberal democracy more fundamentally aligned with the ideals that Washington seeks to uphold.

That, however, is not where India is today. The country is instead led by an ethnonationalist who tolerates little dissent. It is in thrall to an illiberal and increasingly undemocratic party, and that party’s grip on politics is only becoming firmer. Unless that changes, the United States will not be able to treat India as it treats Japan, South Korea, and NATO allies in Europe. It must instead treat India as it treats Jordan, Vietnam, and any number of other illiberal partners. It must, in other words, cooperate with India on the reality of shared interests, not on the hope of shared values."

The US delegation at the 2+2 ministerial talks was led by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh headed the Indian side.

""Our dialogue today will be an opportunity to advance the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden to build a forward-looking partnership and construct a shared global agenda,"" Jaishankar said in his televised opening remarks.

""We are exploring cooperation in new domains such as critical technologies, collaboration in civil outer space and in areas of critical minerals,"" he said.

""The highlight this year was the PM's state visit to the United States in June; it has opened a new chapter in our relationship. President Biden's visit to Delhi in September contributed immensely to the positive trajectory of our ties. His support was key to ensuring productive outcomes at the G20 summit. The dialogue today will be an opportunity to advance the vision of our respective leaders. Building a forward-looking partnership while we construct a shared global agenda,"" Jaishankar said.

In his remarks, Blinken said both sides are promoting a free and open, prosperous, secure and resilient Indo-Pacific including by strengthening the US-India partnership through the Quad.

He said the focus is to bolster the partnership in international peace, security and specifically working to promote rules-based order, uphold principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.

In his opening comments, Singh said the India-US bilateral relationship has seen a growing interest in strategic convergence and enhanced defence cooperation.

""Defence cooperation remains one of the most important pillars of our bilateral relationship,"" he said.

""We look forward to closely working with the US across domains of capability building,"" Singh said.

US Defence Secretary Austin, in his opening remarks, said in the face of urgent global challenges, it is more important than ever that the world's two largest democracies exchange views, find common goals and ""deliver for our people"".

""Our increasingly strong ties give us all hope for the future of this partnership and our common efforts towards a more secure world,"" he said."
72,https://chanakyaforum.com/pm-modis-state-visit-reflects-deep-rooted-india-us-ties/,PM Modi’s State Visit Reflects Deep-Rooted India-US Ties,,"The State Visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the United States reflects the deep roots of the ties between the two largest democracies, India and the US. It was more than a century ago that immigrants from India began to settle in the US, and today there are nearly six million Indian Americans. They are a powerful bridge that helps to ensure that the overall relationship moves in a healthy direction. Prime Minister Modi understands this, and therefore ensures that he gives enough time in his schedule to meet with members of the Indian diaspora in the US. Very often, he is joined in such meetings by senior officials on the US side, who are happy to get an opportunity to reach out to the Indian-American community. Recently in Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was with Prime Minister Modi at a meeting of the Indian diaspora in Sydney, and the two have established a warm friendship. In the same way, Modi has had friendly relations with all three US Presidents he has worked with, namely Barack Obama, Donald Trump and now President Biden. Where India is concerned, there is no difference between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, as both favour close ties between the US and India.

In a democracy, it is common to see different voices being raised on the same subject. In the case of India, there are some in the US who do not favour close ties between their country and India, and who are unhappy that Modi has been given the honour of a State Visit and the opportunity of twice addressing a Joint Session of both Houses of Congress. Very few leaders have been given that honour. In a democracy, citizens have the freedom to express views in a peaceful manner even though their opinions are different from those held by the White House. Of course, there are many more people who welcome Prime Minister Modi’s visit, and they also will express their happiness in public at the State Visit in a peaceful manner. Such differing actions are common in a democracy, and in the relationship between democracies. There remain pending issues between the two sides that remain to be settled, but the importance of good relations between Delhi and Washington is important to both sides, and hence such differences will not affect the warmth of the relationship. A welcome development is that there is finally a US Ambassador to India after a gap of two years when the US embassy in Delhi was without a full-fledged Ambassador. President Biden has sent a close personal friend, Eric Garcetti, as the envoy to India, and as the Ambassador has direct contact with the White House, he can play a key role in ensuring that the relationship between India and the US reaches a high level during the Biden administration.

In a multilateral world any two countries will have some differences of opinion. This is the case on some issues between Delhi and Washington as well. An example is Russia, which is regarded as an adversary by the Biden administration in a way that was the norm during the USSR-US Cold War (1945-91). In contrast, India had friendly ties with the Soviet Union in the past and continues to have friendly ties with the Russian Federation after the collapse of the USSR. This is the reason why India has not condemned Russia nor stopped buying goods from Russia, such as oil. Nor has India joined the western countries in imposing sanctions on Russia. Although such a stand caused some tension during the early months of 2022, soon the western countries understood the Indian position of continuing to have a friendly relationship between Moscow and Delhi, and have avoided any sanctions on India, knowing that such a move would have an adverse effect on public opinion in India towards the west, which is an essential partner of India. As President of the G-20 during 2023, Prime Minister Modi is seeking to ensure that the developed countries give more assistance to the Global South, of which India is a part. A more equitable world order is a central theme of Indian diplomacy, which is focussed on ensuring that global institutions serve as neutral platforms rather than promote the interests of any one group of countries at the expense of others. India has always opposed a unipolar world order and supports a multilateral world order that ensures equality and justice to all countries big and small, rich or poor.

The June 21-23 State Visit of Prime Minister Modi to the US to meet President Biden is certain to deepen the already strong ties between Washington and Delhi. The Prime Minister will also have the opportunity of meeting US legislators in his address to the Joint Session of the US Congress, and this is welcome. In the US as in India, the Legislative Branch of government is co-equal with the Executive Branch. It is important to look at the big picture that shows the importance of close India-US ties in the 21st century rather than only concentrate on small issues on which the two sides may have differences of opinion."

The India-US ‘2+2’ foreign and defence ministerial dialogue took place amid growing geopolitical turmoil, largely triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war, the escalating conflict between Hamas and Israel in West Asia.

The American delegation at the ‘2+2’ ministerial dialogue was led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin while External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh headed the Indian side.

In his televised opening remarks, Jaishankar said the dialogue was an opportunity to advance the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden to build a forward looking partnership and construct a shared global agenda.

Blinken said the US and India have a robust partnership and both sides are deliberating on matters with implications for the future.

“We are bolstering the partnership in international peace, security and specifically working to promote rules-based order, and uphold principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. Our defence cooperation is a key pillar of that work,” he said.

He also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US in June and US President Biden’s subsequent trip to India in September to attend the G20 Summit.

“The highlight of this year was the prime minister’s state visit to the US in June which has truly opened a new chapter in our relationship. President Biden’s visit to Delhi in September contributed immensely to the positive trajectory of our ties,” he said.

“The dialogue today will be an opportunity to advance the vision of our respective leaders, building a forward-looking partnership while we construct a shared global agenda,” he said.

“In the 2+2, we will undertake as we have done before, a comprehensive overview of cross-cutting strategic, defence, and security ties, technology and supply chain collaborations and people-to-people exchanges,” he said.

Jaishankar said the ties between India and the US are making significant progress.

“Our meeting takes place even as we make rapid strides in all aspects of our bilateral agenda. Our trade is today in excess of USD 200 billion, FDI is rising in both directions,” he said.

In his comments, Singh said the India-US bilateral relationship has seen a growing interest of strategic convergence and that defence remains one of the most important pillars of the ties.

“In spite of various emerging geopolitical challenges, we need to keep our focus on important and long-term issues. Our partnership is critical for ensuring a free, open and rules-bound Indo-Pacific region,” Singh said.

“We look forward to closely working with the US across the domains of defence for capability building and for abiding partnerships which can address emerging challenges,” he said.

In his remarks, Austin said in the face of urgent global challenges, it is more important than ever that the world’s two largest democracies exchange views, find common goals and “deliver for our people”.

“We have made impressive gains in building our major defence partnership over the past year, and that will help us contribute even more together to the cause of peace and stability,” he said.

“We are integrating our industrial bases, strengthening our interoperability, and sharing cutting-edge technology. The scope of our cooperation is vast. It stretches from the sea-bed to space,” he said.

“The strength of our partnership is rooted in the people-to-people ties that are the heart of our long-standing friendship together. Our diplomats, entrepreneurs, and students are expanding our partnership in new domains, including clean energy, artificial intelligence, and semiconductors,” he said.

Austin said the increasingly strong US-India ties “give us all hope for the future of this partnership and for our common efforts toward a more secure world”.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Pool

India and the United States announced progress on key defence deals and said they would expand their growing partnership in the face of geopolitical challenges as their top diplomats and senior ministers met on Friday.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi as part of their annual ""2+2 Dialogue"", focused on the Indo-Pacific region.

The two countries which were once on opposite sides of the Cold War are now working on landmark deals including for the US to supply and manufacture engines for Indian fighter jets.

Indian Defence Secretary Giridhar Aramane said that deal between the aerospace unit of General Electric and India's state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics was on track.

""We are finalising the commercial arrangements and the necessary legal requirements are being put in place,"" he told reporters after the talks.

A more than $3 billion deal for India to buy 31 armed drones made by General Atomics is also being processed and India is waiting for the company to get US government clearances for the next steps, Aramane said.

Washington had offered several infantry combat vehicle systems and New Delhi has expressed interest, he added without giving details.

Indian media reports have said the Pentagon has offered the Stryker family of eight-wheeled armoured fighting vehicles produced by General Dynamic Land Systems and that New Delhi is interested in jointly manufacturing them in India.

Before the talks, Defense Secretary Austin said it was more important than ever that the world's two largest democracies exchange views and find common goals ""in the face of urgent global challenges"".

""We're integrating our industrial bases, strengthening our inter-operability and sharing cutting-edge technology,"" he said.

India-U.S. relations have steadily grown stronger on several fronts in the last two decades but New Delhi has also carefully preserved long-standing relations with Russia, much to the frustration of the West amid the war in Ukraine.

India has close strategic links with Israel and strong diplomatic and economic relationships with oil and gas producing countries in the Middle East.

New Delhi has condemned the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants in Israel as a ""terrorist attack"" while also reiterating its longstanding position for an independent Palestine.

A joint statement issued after Friday's talks said the two sides called for the ""immediate release of all remaining hostages"" in Gaza.

""They expressed support for humanitarian pauses and committed to continue close diplomatic coordination, including with key partners in the region, to prevent the conflict from spreading, preserve stability in the Middle East, and work toward a political solution and durable peace,"" it said."

Highlights of the 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue

Key Outcomes of the Dialogue

The dialogue led to several key outcomes. The ministers reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening the defense partnership, bolstering counter-terrorism and law enforcement cooperation, building science and technology collaborations, and expanding health and trade dialogues. They also emphasized the importance of strengthening people-to-people ties and addressing regional security issues in the Indo-Pacific.

Impact on the Geopolitical Landscape

The song is among the nominees for the Best Global Music Performance category at the Grammy Awards, competing with tracks such as Shadow Forces by Arooj Aftab, Vijay Iyer, and Shahzad Ismaily; Alone by Burna Boy, Feel by Davido, Milagro Y Disastre by Silvana Estrada, Pashto by Bela Fleck, Edgar Meyer and Zakir Hussain featuring Rakesh Chaurasia, and Todo Colores by Ibrahim Maalouf featuring Cimafunk and Tank and the Bangas.

Earlier this year, Indian-American singer Falguni Shah expressed her honour in collaborating on ""Abundance in Millets,"" inspired by PM Narendra Modi's proposal to the UN to declare 2023 as the International Year of Millets. The Prime Minister unveiled the album cover during his June visit to the US, commending Shah for her efforts in promoting millets and addressing world hunger.

Earlier, Falguni Shah received praise from Prime Minister Modi for the song, acknowledging her contribution to creating awareness about healthy and environmentally friendly millets and bringing people together through her music. Falu had previously won the Best Children's Music Album Grammy for 'A Colourful World' on April 4, 2022, with PM Modi extending his best wishes for her achievement.

Grammy released the list of 2024 GRAMMY Nominations, and it includes the song Abundance In Millets by Falguni Shah and her husband Gaurav Shah.

The Grammy nomination for the song says, Abundance In Millets, Falu & Gaurav Shah (Featuring PM Narendra Modi).

The song Abundance In Millets was released to boost awareness around the importance of millets as the world is celebrating the year 2023 as the International Year of Millets. While the Shah couple has sung the song, it includes a portion of PM Modi’s speech on international millet year. In the snippet of the PM’s quotes, he is heard talking about adapting millets as part of our lifestyle. He says it will benefit the farmers of the country.

The song along with the video captures the cultivation of millet in India and narrates how it can play a crucial role in curbing hunger. The song promotes the consumption of millets among people from all walks of life as it is also very nutritious and can benefit the overall health of a person.

Besides singing the song, Falu (Falguni Shah) and Gaurav Shah also composed and wrote the song, along with Kenya Autie, Greg Gonzalez and Soumya Chatterjee. The song was written in both English and Hindi.

If the song wins the award, it will be the second Grammy for Falu, as she won the Grammy Award in 2022 for her 2021 album A Colorful World. She said the idea to write a song about millets came to her when she met PM Modi in New Delhi last year after her Grammy win.

On the Millet song, she said, “Prime Minister Modi has written a song with me and my husband Gaurav Shah.”

She said that PM Narendra Modi suggested to her she should write a song with a message of ending hunger during their discussion on the power of music to bring change and uplift humanity. As per her, the PM told her that India promotes millet because it is a super grain and has immense health and nutritional value.

After that, Falu asked if PM Modi will collaborate in writing the song, to which he agreed. She said that she was initially nervous about writing the song with PM Modi, but the whole collaboration happened in a very organic way.

“It’s one thing to write for him and it’s one thing to write with him. In the middle of the song, you will hear the speech that he has written and narrated in his own voice,” she said. Falguni Shah had added that she was “honoured” and “humbled” to collaborate with PM Narendra Modi on the millet` song."

INTERNATIONAL:

Israel’s Genocidal War on Gaza:

Israel is intensifying its unprecedented inhuman assault against the Palestinians. The Israeli defense forces have begun their ground invasion of the Gaza strip in the name of retaliatory action against the Hamas attacks in Israel. This operation has been mounted in which more than 8,000 people, 4,000 whom are children, have been killed so far. Most gruesome has been the Israeli bombings on hospitals, schools, churches and human shelters. The intention is clear, Israel seeks to convert Gaza into a rubble expelling all Palestinians to move into neighbouring Egypt and other countries and formally annex the Gaza strip as part of Israel.

As a result of a gigantic imperialist conspiracy and fraud, the Palestinians are continuously denied their right to their homeland. The most rightwing Netanyahu government in Israel has, in recent months, intensified the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands, patronized the creation of private armies by the illegal Jewish settlers in the West Bank and now threatens to launch a war of extermination.

World imperialism led by the USA has pronounced unabashed support to Israel in this enterprise. Biden, Rishi Sunak, Macron and the German Chancellor Olaf Scolz visited Israel to personally express solidarity with Netanyahu. The USA has established, over the decades, Israel as its outpost in West Asia and has been funding it to the tune of more than $4 billion a year apart from providing it with the most advanced military technologies and armaments.

It is shocking that India abstained on a Resolution overwhelmingly adopted by the UN General Assembly calling for a humanitarian truce titled “Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations” in the ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza.

India’s abstention on a resolution that was overwhelmingly adopted shows the extent to which Indian foreign policy is being shaped by being a subordinate ally of US imperialism and the Modi government’s actions for consolidating the US-Israel-India nexus. This negated India’s longstanding support to the Palestinian cause.

Global protests against Israeli attack on Gaza are being held in many places around the world. In London, more than 3,00,000 people had gathered and rallied against the attacks on Palestine. Huge protests took place in Lebanon, Iran, Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Yemen, Egypt, Morocco, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Rome, Dublin, Glasgow, Geneva, Sydney, Toronto, Sweden, Denmark and many other countries across the world. France and Germany have banned any sort of solidarity protest actions for Palestine and even to display the Palestinian flag. In spite of the ban, protests are being held. In the US, protests against Israel were led by Jewish groups, who marched into the Capitol Hill in Washington. Similar protests were held in New York, Los Angeles and Detroit. Communist MPs in Israel are suspended from Knesset, the Parliament in Israel, for supporting Palestine and demanding an immediate end to these attacks.

The growing public opinion across the world against Israel’s war in Gaza and for an immediate ceasefire must be further strengthened to force Israel to accept the implementation of UN mandated 2-state solution with East Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian State with pre-1967 borders.

Global Economy:

The crisis in the global capitalist economy continues to persist. As noted in our last Central Committee meeting, neoliberalism repeatedly demonstrates its bankruptcy in offering any solution for a way out of this crisis. But at the same time, it zealously continues to realise its objective of predatory profit maximization. This is leading to a further accentuation of inequalities. The living condition for the vast majority of people in terms of growing hunger and poverty worsened.

IMF World Economic Outlook Report October 2023, retained its July forecast for global growth to slow from 3.5 percent in 2022 to 3.0 percent in 2023 and 2.9 percent in 2024, well below the average of 3.8 percent, seen during 2000-19. Advanced economies are expected to slow down from 2.6 percent in 2022 to 1.5 percent in 2023 and 1.4 percent in 2024.

Poverty: According to the UN, almost 700 million people around the world live in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than $2.15 per day. At current rates of progress, the world will likely not meet the global goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030, with estimates indicating that nearly 600 million people will still be struggling with extreme poverty then. According to a report of the World Bank-UNICEF, children are more than twice as likely as adults to live in extreme poverty. They comprise more than half of those living in extreme poverty, yet their share of the total population is just 31 percent.

Global Hunger:

The 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI) shows that progress against hunger world-wide remains largely at a standstill. As the effects of crises multiply and intensify, more and more people are experiencing severe hunger, with the situation expected to worsen throughout the year. The prevalence of undernourishment has been on the rise, and the number of undernourished people has climbed from 572 million to about 735 million.

Ukraine War:

For more than 600 days the war in Ukraine continues. Despite the failure of the Ukrainian counter offensive, US imperialism and the NATO allies are financing and arming Ukraine fully prolonging the war hoping to reduce Russia to bankruptcy. Reportedly there have been many civilian casualties in this war. From 24 February 2022, which marked the start of the large-scale conflict, to 24 September 2023, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 27,449 civilian casualties in the country: 9,701 killed and 17,748 injured.

Rightward Political Shift:

While the general tendency in world politics remans the political rightward shift, in some countries in recent elections, the far right suffered setbacks. This indicates growing popular discontent against the authoritarian rightwing governments and their anti-people economic policies.

Poland:

In the general elections held in Poland, all the opposition parties together have secured enough votes to oust the ruling right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party. Though the PiS won 35.38 percent votes, ahead of centrist opposition Civic Coalition which secured 30.7 percent, it would not be in position to form the government. The Civic Coalition is in discussions with centre-right Third Way and New Left parties and is trying to form an alliance. PiS has lost 41 seats since the last election and even if it did form a coalition with the far-right Confederation party, it would be 19 seats below the required number. The election witnessed one of the highest voter turnouts after the dismantling of socialism, with 74.38 percent voting. Majority of the youth and women voted against the existing right-wing government.

Slovakia:

An early parliamentary election was held in Slovakia on 30 September 2023 to elect members of the National Council. The social democratic, Direction – Social Democracy (Smer-SD), led by former Prime Minister Robert Fico, emerged as the largest party, winning 42 seats. The social-liberal and pro-European, Progressive Slovakia (PS) came second, with 32 seats. Social-democratic, Voice – Social Democracy which split from Smer-SD in 2020, came third with 27 seats. The conservative, OĽaNO and its allies won 16 seats, less than a quarter of their total in the 2020 election. As no singular party or alliance reached the 76 seats needed for a majority, a coalition government may be formed. The major election issues were high inflation and Slovakia's position on the war in Ukraine. The Smer-SD campaigned promising to end the country’s support to the war in Ukraine.

Guatemala:

Progressive candidate Bernardo Arévalo won Guatemala’s presidential election held on 23 August, but the same day the government ordered his political party suspended on the allegation that they did not submit valid signatures for registering their party. The vote for Arevalo is a reflection of the desire of the Guatemalans for a change, as they have grown disillusioned with endemic corruption. Arévalo and his supporters faced waves of judicial attacks in an attempt to disbar them from contesting the elections. He obtained 60.9 percent of the votes cast, against 37.2 percent for the right-wing Sandra Torres, but his party won only 23 seats in the 160-seat Congress. Plots to assassinate the president-elect by the country’s ruling classes are seeing light. Arevalo is the son of former president Juan José Arévalo, who was ousted in a CIA inspired coup in 1954.

Argentina:

Argentina went to polls for a general election on 22 October. Javier Milei, a far-right leader of the Liberty Advances party was the front runner in the August primary. However, in the October 22 poll, the far right suffered a big setback. The Peronist coalition candidate Sergio Massa polled over 6.6 per cent more votes (36.6 per cent) than Javier Milei (30 per cent), thus, a runoff election became inevitable which is slated to be held on November 19.

Maldives:

Opposition candidate Mohamed Muiz won the presidential runoff with more than 53 percent of the vote. The election has turned into a virtual referendum on whether India or China will have the bigger influence in the small nation. Muiz promised he would remove Indian troops from the Maldives and balance the country’s trade relations, which he said were heavily in India’s favor. The elections were also a reflection of the public anger against the government’s failure to meet economic and governance expectations.

NATIONAL:

INDIA Bloc:

Party attended the third meeting of the constituents of the INDIA bloc held at Mumbai and decided to work for the further consolidation and expansion of INDIA bloc to strengthen the efforts to safeguard the secular democratic character of the Indian Republic, the Constitution, Democracy and People’s fundamental rights and civil liberties. This requires that the BJP must be kept away from controlling the Union government and State Power. The Polit Bureau decided to further strengthen these efforts and reiterated the CPI(M) position at the last three meetings of INDIA bloc in Patna, Bengaluru and Mumbai to organize a series of public meetings across the country and to mobilize the people to ensure the defeat of the BJP in the forthcoming elections. Efforts should be focused to further expand the INDIA bloc and also to draw in significant sections of the people’s movements in this effort. While all decisions will be taken by the leaders of the constituents, there should be no organizational structures that will be an impediment for such decisions.

Manipur:

The situation in Manipur continues to deteriorate. The Modi government is refusing to intervene and remove the Chief Minister, whose handling of the situation has actually worsened ethnic tensions and violence.

In the last Central Committee meeting, we noted that the BJP, with the agenda of sharpening polarization across the North East, is also seeking to give a communal color in Manipur by merging ethnic and religious identities.

Officially, the state police have declared a death toll of 175 (in reality, the figure will be much higher) and stated that at least 96 bodies remain unclaimed, with an additional 32 officially listed as missing. Official records show 5,172 cases of arson, including 4,786 houses and 386 religious places. Though a total of 5,668 firearms were looted, only 1,329 of these have been recovered.

Chief Minister Biren Singh must be immediately sacked, and the mayhem in Manipur must be brought to a halt.

Indian Economy:

With the cementing of the corporate-communal nexus under the Modi government, the bulk of the wealth generated in the country is cornered by the cronies. Tax concessions and incentives given to the rich and corporates are widening the gulf between the two India’s – the rich and the poor. Real income of the top 1 per cent rose by 30 per cent from Rs 7.9 lakh crores in 2019 to Rs. 10.2 lakh crore in 2022, while real income of the lowest 25 per cent fell by 11 per cent from Rs. 3.8 lakh crore to Rs. 3.4 lakh crore.

A relentless propaganda continues to boast of India’s economic resurgence. The recent G-20 Summit was used to project India as an emerging economic powerhouse in the world. But the truth is that India has the lowest per capita GDP amongst the G-20 countries; ranks the lowest in terms of Human Development Indices and records the lowest Labour Force Participation Rate, reflecting very high levels of unemployment.

The continued decline in people’s purchasing power is impeding economic growth as this leads to declining levels of domestic demand. This, in turn, leads to declining levels of investments. This means potentially further declining levels of employment generation. New proposals for investment in the economy have rapidly declined over the last year – 72.5 per cent in government investments and 79.2 per cent in private investments.

Massive propaganda blitz is launched over the grand success of ‘Make in India’. Its target for manufacturing sector growth over this decade was 12-14 per cent. The reality is that since 2013-14, this averaged 5.9 per cent per annuam. The share of manufacturing in GDP was targeted to reach 25 per cent. This, however, remained stagnant at around 16.4 per cent. Between 2011-12 and 2021-22, jobs in manufacturing sector declined from 12.6 per cent to 11.6 per cent.

Deepening rural distress is reflected in the demands for jobs under the MGNREGS. Last year, this grew by 15.3 per cent and compared to 2019-20, this grew by 29.4 per cent.

Unemployment:

Modi government boasts of a 6-year low unemployment rate in 2022-23. However, in August 2023, the unemployment rate was estimated as 8.1 per cent. Youth unemployment (15-24 years) was 23.22 per cent. Among graduates, it is a whopping 42 per cent. Nearly 2 crore families demanded work under MGNREGS.

The recent data released by Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFFS) for July 2022 to June 2023 showing a six year low of unemployment at 3.2 per cent is explained by the same data as being due to an increasing share in self-employment. From around 52 per cent in 2018-19, the rate of self-employed people rose to 57.3 per cent in 2022-23. Self-employed consists of two categories the artisans and hawkers and unpaid family labour. The share of the latter, has increased the most from 17.3 per cent in 2020-21 to 18.3 per cent in 2022-23. The reality is that since there are few jobs available, most people have stopped looking for employment and are forced to be self-employed. The decline in jobs in the casual jobs category is resulting in a reverse migration to rural areas and hence greater demand for jobs under MGNREGS. An important element is that massive number of women have dropped out of the workforce returning to work as unpaid family labour. The most distressing trend the PFLS survey shows is that the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) and Worker Population Ratios (WPR) of Muslims sharply declined. The LFPR declined from 35.5 per cent in 2020-21 to 32.5 per cent in 2022-23 and WPR from 33.9 per cent to 32.5 per cent. The Muslim minority appears to have simply stopped looking for jobs as they are failing to find employment.

The CMIE data which does not consider unpaid family labour as employment shows a rise in the unemployment rate.

Price Rise:

Modi government propaganda claims that runaway inflation is under control and has come below the RBI threshold level of 6 per cent. However, the official Whole Sale Price Index shows that prices have risen on an average by around 30 per cent in May 2023 compared to May 2014. Wheat price has grown 53 per cent, rice by 43 per cent, pulses by 56 per cent, fruits and vegetables by 43 per cent, milk by 42 per cent and eggs by 45 per cent. This is the average over this decade. There have been periodic spikes taking some essentials beyond the reach of the common man.

Constant hiking of prices of petroleum products contributed to the overall growth of inflation. The Central government share of taxes on petroleum products has grown from Rs. 1.26 lakh crores in 2014-15 to Rs. 4.32 lakh crore in 2021-22 – a growth of 243 per cent. This is happening when the global oil price is markedly lower today than in May 2014. India’s crude imports costed $107 for a barrel in May 2014. In May 2023 this was less than $ 75. While global price has dropped by around 30 per cent, the domestic prices of petrol rose by 35 per cent and diesel by 60 per cent. Non-subsidized LPG prices more than doubled since September 2016.

The net result of this rise in cost of living is reflected in the decline in the financial assets of households as a percentage of GDP. This dropped from 15.4 per cent in 2020-21 to 10.9 per cent in 2022-23. The net financial assets for households plummeted from 11.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent of the GDP. The consequence is the mounting indebtedness of households.

With people’s incomes on the decline, rising prices, soaring unemployment, it was only natural that India’s ranking in the global hunger index plummeted down to 111 out of 125 countries. India's child wasting rate, at 18.7 percent, is the highest child wasting rate; its child stunting rate is 35.5 percent; its prevalence of undernourishment is 16.6 percent; and its under-five mortality rate is 3.1 percent.

Vishwakarma Scheme:

With great fanfare Modi announced at the Red Fort on Independence Day that the government would spend Rs.13,000-15,000 crore for development of skilled artisans. However, what was announced in the Parliament, subsequently, was a Rs. 13,000 crore package of loans to be disbursed over the next 5 years with a 5 per cent interest rate. Hence, Modi’s announcement at the Red Fort was totally misleading. Further, in the name of promoting skilled artisans what is being perpetuated is the hereditary occupation of such families that are based on caste divisions which define their occupations.

Adani Affair:

Fresh evidences that have emerged about Adani group’s manipulation of stock prices of its companies’ calls for a serious probe and the Supreme Court which is seized of the matter has to ensure that there are no cover ups. The Financial Times and The Guardian have, based on inputs from the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, revealed how two close associates of Vinod Adani used an investment fund in Bermuda and set-up shell companies to buy millions of dollars of shares in the Adani companies. This is a total violation of existing regulatory provisions.

The reports also show that the SEBI was looking into the matter of offshore funding of Adani companies in 2014 but had closed the enquiries subsequently.

Later, in October, the Financial Times exposed another detailed investigation pointing to using ‘offshore intermediaries’ to import $5 billion worth of coal at prices that were at times more than double the market price. The rates of electricity charges are fixed in India on the basis of the price of imported coal. Thus, crores of Indians have been overpaying for electricity fattening the profits of Adani.

Adani’s links with Prime Minister Modi have so far ensured that the regulatory authorities do not take any action against such widespread fraud and manipulation.

One Nation-One Election:

The high-level committee set up by the Union government, under the chairmanship of Ram Nath Kovind, former President of India, to examine the implementation of this proposal has now sought the opinion of political parties and asked for their viewpoint in writing by the 18th of January 2024, keeping in mind the general elections a few months later. The Central Committee has, already, taken a clear-cut position against this proposal. This proposal would constitute a twin assault on Parliamentary democracy and Federalism as enshrined in our Constitution. Apart from significant amendments to the Constitution, such a proposal would entail either curtailing or extending the life of State Assemblies to synchronize them with Lok Sabha elections. When a government loses its majority on the floor of the House, its continuation is illegal. If Central rule is imposed, denying people their right to elect a government, then it is anti-democratic.

Women’s Reservation Bill:

The special session of Parliament, convened with its agenda shrouded in secrecy, was designed to spring a surprise move to enact the women’s’ reservation bill hoping that it will give the BJP an extra mile in the 2024 general elections. First, it has come after a long wait of 27 years. Secondly, it has come at the far end of the Modi government’s second term, despite Modi promising that this shall be the first Act of his government when elected in 2014. Thirdly, and importantly, though the legislation has been adopted by Parliament its implementation will have to wait probably well beyond the next general elections scheduled for 2029. This is because the legislation states that reservation of seats in Parliament and state assemblies will be done only after the next census operation and subsequent delimitation of seats which is slated to begin in 2026 are carried out. This is clearly a move to delay the implementation of Women Reservations. These reservations need not wait for the census and the delimitation exercise. As and when these happen the appropriate changes can be incorporated.

Clearly, this Bill was brought in for gaining electoral milage, but has been received by the people as a gimmickry and a sense of being cheated.

The RSS/BJP who promote the values of a Manuvadi social order based on caste and gender oppression consider providing equality for women as an anathema.

NCERT Text Book Recommendations:

NCERT recommended that only the name Bharat should be included in the textbooks and not what the Constitution defines the name of the country being `India that is Bharat’. The LDF government in Kerala has rightly rejected the NCERT proposal. In July, the NCERT notified a new committee for developing new text books to be loaded with the `ancient knowledge of India’. Various BJP led state government have suggested the deletion of all history connected with the Muslims or the British rule in India to be replaced by the essence of the Upanishads, Bhagawat Gita, Mahabharat and Ramayana. In short, the effort is to replace the rich syncretic history of India with Hindu mythology and the equally rich cross currents of Indian philosophy with Hindu theology.

Attacks on Expressions of Dissent:

The largescale attacks on democratic rights and civil liberties, guaranteed to every Indian by the Constitution, continue to intensify. The media that speaks truth to power showing the reality rather than promoting the orchestrated propaganda and spin of the Modi government is particularly targeted. The latest is the attack on NewsClick whose founding editor and HR head have been arrested under the draconian UAPA. This is a brazen attempt to suppress this news portal that is critical of government’s policies and Hindutva communal politics of sharpening polarization. Apart from the two arrested, the houses of nearly 50 journalists and others associated with NewsClick were raided and laptops and mobiles were seized. Acting directly under the Union Home Ministry, the police questioned all those raided regarding their coverage of the historic farmers’ struggle; anti-CAA protests and the Delhi communal violence. Prior to these raids and arrests, the ED initiated legal proceedings against NewsClick alleging money laundering and over foreign investments and funding. Not a single charge was tenable in the courts. Unable to prove any of these, a New York Times article on the investments made by an American millionaire now living in Shanghai, China, to various entities including NewsClick was used as a pretext for the UAPA to be invoked on charges of being anti-national. Clearly, these actions are a result of a political agenda to target, isolate and attack any media organization that does not bow to the demands of servile conformism demanded by the BJP.

Caste Census:

The Central Committee asked the Modi government to conduct a caste census enumerating socio-economic status along with the 2021 General Census, which is long overdue. Such a caste census is necessary to ensure that legal entitlements, including reservations, reach all those who deserve them the most.

Bihar has conducted a state-level caste survey, and some other states have declared their intention to do so. The decision on conducting state-level surveys is the prerogative of the elected state governments. However, these cannot be a substitute for an all-India caste census, which is the essential basis to determine the disbursement of entitlements.

Hate speech in Parliament:

The spread of poisonous campaigns of hate speech against minorities, Muslims in particular, promoted and patronized by the ruling BJP found reflection in the special session of the parliament and in a sense heralded the ambience that would dominate in the new Parliament building under a BJP government. A BJP MP from Delhi unleashed the most foul and crude anti-Muslim epithets against a Muslim BSP MP in the Lok Sabha. The speech laced with the filthiest language and unrepeatable abuses should have normally led to the Lok Sabha Speaker taking strong action against the offending MP. Many opposition MPs were suspended earlier on flimsy grounds. Clearly, this is an open patronage and protection being provided by the ruling BJP encouraging such incendiary anti-Muslim hatred.

Calls for a genocide against the Muslims are regularly voiced in ‘Dharm Sansads’ across the country particularly in BJP ruled states. Lynching and broad daylight murders of Muslim youth over allegations of cow smuggling; supplying beef etc. are regularly occurring in BJP ruled states. The hatred has reached such levels that a school teacher calls upon fellow students to slap a Muslim boy; shooting dead Muslims by a Railway Protection Force constable in a moving train; threatening economic boycott of Muslims etc. Downright provocative public insulting of Muslims leading to violence and riots are becoming common place.

According to the United Christian Forum (UCF) there have been 525 attacks against Christians in India in the first 8 months of 2023. This data does not include the violence and destruction of Churches in Manipur since the ethnic violence started in May 3. Most of these are vigilante attacks and mob violence. From 151 attacks on Christian minorities in 2014, these have steadily increased to 599 in 2022 and 525 in the first 8 months of 2023.

Jammu and Kashmir:

Despite all tall claims of economic development and end to terrorism, the situation in Jammu and Kashmir has markedly deteriorated. Democratic rights are severely restricted. There are high levels of unemployment. The Union government is refusing to hold assembly elections even after the completion of the delimitation exercise, the publishing of the electoral rolls and claims of establishing peace and normalcy.

Dissatisfaction and disillusionment are increasingly being expressed in Ladakh region which consists of Leh and Kargil districts. A coordination committee of Leh apex body and Kargil Democratic Alliance has been formed in support of their four-point agenda which include: full-fledged statehood for Ladakh; constitutional safeguards under the 6th schedule of the Indian Constitution, early recruitment process & safeguarding of land rights.

In recently held Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Kargil elections for 26 seats, only 2 seats were won by BJP, while NC-Congress alliance won 22 seats and 2 independents who got elected have expressed their support to the alliance. Despite desperate attempts and misuse of official machinery by the BJP, electorate has conveyed a message that they will not be hoodwinked by the nefarious policies of the BJP government anymore.

All measurers eroding the domicile status of the permanent residents of J & K must be reversed and their land rights must be protected.

Democracy must be restored with the release of all political prisoners and the withdrawal of cases under draconian laws foisted on political persons and media.

Growing Popular Struggles:

Vachathi Struggle:

Thirty-one years after the might of the State was unleashed against an adivasi community in Vachathi village in Tamil Nadu’s Dharmapuri district, the Madras High Court in its order on September 29, 2023 upheld the verdict of the trial court, holding the surviving 215 (of the original 269) officials guilty of charges under the IPC and atrocities under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.

On June 20, 1992, a joint force of the Forest, Police and the Revenue Departments descended on the tribal village in an ostensible “crackdown on sandalwood logging”. The raid left in its wake, a trail of gendered violence, with the rape of 18 tribal women and the pillage of a village, including poisoning of its wells.

The verdict assumes importance as government after government in the state unabashedly used all its might in seeking to protect the perpetrators of this heinous crime. It was only after the Madras High Court was approached by the then CPI(M) State Secretary A Nallasivan that the FIR was lodged and the case taken over by the CBI. The stellar role played by the Tamil Nadu Tribal Association and the legal team that painstakingly and steadfastly fought the case has to be appreciated. The courage and determination with which the victims fought the system overcoming threats, intimidation and terrible hostility is commendable.

Against Price Rise and for Employment:

Responding to the call of the last Central Committee to observe a protest week throughout the country against price rise and for job creation, significant protest actions took place all across the country. With the relentless increase in the prices of essential commodities, this campaign resonated with the people.

Worker-Kisan Joint Convention:

Thousands of workers and farmers converged in Delhi on August 24 for a convention aimed at strengthening joint struggles against the anti-worker, anti-farmer, and anti-people neo-liberal policies pursued by the current BJP government. On the anniversary of the historic kisan struggle and the All India trade union strike call, a three-day nationwide protest action will take place from November 26-28.

Women's March:

Over 7,000 women from 23 states across the country gathered in Delhi to protest the BJP government's policies, opposing the Hindutva Manuvadi ideology and the pernicious communal polarization that is intensifying. The clarion call was to oust the BJP government.

Murder of Democracy in Tripura:

Unleashing of widespread terror and complete rigging by the ruling BJP marked the recent by elections to Tripura assembly constituencies. An extraordinary situation of terror was created under the direct supervision of the state government and law enforcement authorities. Total rigging was resorted to. These elections ought to have been countermanded and fresh polls under strict security arrangements should have been held.

G-20 Summit:

Following the 1999 Southeast Asian economic collapse, the G7 was expanded to the G20 when the world's richest countries brought in emerging economies to share the burden of the economic crisis that inevitably followed the neo-liberal economic reforms trajectory. The initial ministerial-level consultation was elevated to the heads of government summit following the global financial meltdown in 2008. Since then, an annual rotational presidency method was adopted, which has little to do with the state of the domestic economy or the socio-political situation in the country assuming the presidency.

The last summit meeting in India was a significant propaganda blitz for the Modi government, portrayed as a great achievement under Modi's leadership. Over Rs. 4,100 crore was spent on massive publicity materials, exceeding the budgetary allocation of Rs. 990 crores for hosting the summit. The international media quickly noted that this propaganda aimed to project Modi as a central figure on the international stage. The British paper, The Observer, editorially commented on Modi's ""blatant use of the summit to boost his personal image and his chances in the next year's Indian election."" The USA and all its Western allies viewed this as a summit to cement India as a crucial ally in their efforts to isolate China and advance the latest edition of a new Cold War. This strong desire by imperialist allies allowed the adoption of a joint declaration, smoothing the sharp divisions over naming Russia as the aggressor in the Ukraine war.

There was another reason why the USA was eager to allow Modi to boost his personal global standing. The USA finalized the defense contracts agreed upon during Modi's visit to the US earlier for the purchase of jet engines, armed drones, and other military arsenals. Major decisions on deepening military collaboration between India and the USA were reached. India also agreed to reduce customs duties on apples, almonds and other agreed commodities from the USA, to the detriment of Indian farmers. The USA took the initiative to create the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMSE) as a counter to the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). However, the details of financing such a project and its economic viability were not worked out.

On all other major issues facing developing countries, little tangible progress was made, especially on issues like climate change and financing the transition to greener technologies for developing countries. No concrete decisions were made regarding the outstanding debt of poor countries, which increased by $800 billion over the past year, due to hikes in interest rates by the USA.

G 77 Summit:

Following the G 20 Summit, Modi government projected itself as the leader of the ‘Global South’. Yet, the Indian Foreign Minister who had announced his participation at the G-77 Summit in Havana, Cuba absented himself. Clearly, Modi government, as a subordinate ally of USA, chose not to have a ministerial presence at this most representative gathering of the ‘Global South’ – by travelling to Socialist Cuba in order not to annoy USA.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with their Indian counterparts in New Delhi as part of an Asian trip aimed at showing unity over Russia’s war in Ukraine and preventing differences on the Israel-Hamas war from deepening.

Blinken said the U.S. and India were continuing to “deepen our collaboration on everything from emerging technologies to defense to people-to-people ties” and align diplomacy for “an Indo-Pacific region that’s free, that’s open, that’s prosperous, that’s resilient.”

He said the two sides discussed the crisis in the Middle East and “we appreciate the fact that from day one India has strongly condemned the attacks of Oct. 7. And as our joint statement makes clear, India and the United States stand with Israel against terrorists.”

Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said the situation in the Middle East was a big concern. While India has condemned the Hamas attack on Israel, it balances its position by calling for talks on “a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine living within secure and recognized borders, side-by-side at peace with Israel.”

Blinken met with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and “reaffirmed their shared vision for close partnership in the Indo-Pacific,” said U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.

“They emphasized working together to address ongoing crises such as Russia’s war against Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East,” Miller said.

Vinay Mohan Kwatra, India’s top bureaucrat in the foreign ministry, said India’s tense ties with China also were discussed at the official-level talks, but declined to give details.

​India’s relationship with China has deteriorated since 2020, when Indian and Chinese troops clashed along their disputed border in the Himalayan Ladakh region, leaving 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead. A standoff involving thousands of soldiers in the eastern Ladakh region continues, despite several rounds of military and diplomatic talks.

Blinken said he also discussed with the Indian side a diplomatic dispute that erupted when Canada alleged that India was involved in the assassination of a Sikh separatist in Canada.

Blinken said that the U.S. wants the two sides to resolve their differences in a cooperative way and urged India to “work with Canada on its investigation.”

The dispute started when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were “credible allegations” of Indian involvement in the killing of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar in suburban Vancouver in western Canada. India rejected the accusation.

India and the U.S. have held so-called two-plus-two talks between India’s external affairs and defense ministers and the U.S. secretaries of state and defense since 2018 to discuss issues of concern and strengthen bilateral ties.

Austin and his Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh, discussed a roadmap for defense industrial cooperation that will fast-track technology cooperation and co-production of defense systems, India’s defense ministry said.

“We’re integrating our industrial bases, strengthening our inter-operability, and sharing cutting-edge technology,” Austin said in his opening remarks.

Washington expects India to be a leading security provider in the Indo-Pacific region.

During Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States in June, the two sides adopted a policy guide for defense industries to enable them to produce advanced defense systems together and collaborate on research and testing of prototypes.

The two sides reached an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.

A joint statement at the conclusion of Blinken and Austin’s visit to New Delhi on Friday said the two sides reaffirmed their roadmap for defense industrial cooperation to strengthen India’s capabilities, enhance its defense production, facilitate technology-sharing, and promote supply chain resilience.

IPEF, a group of 14 countries, was launched jointly by the US and other partner countries of the Indo-Pacific region on May 23 in Tokyo. These nations represent 40 per cent of global GDP and 28 per cent of global goods and services trade.

The commerce ministry said in a statement on Friday that the minister would also participate in the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).

Besides, he will also interact with eminent business persons, prominent academics, US officials and industry leaders to further strengthen economic and commercial relations between the two nations.

""The minister will participate in the third in-person IPEF Ministerial meeting from November 13-14, 2023, which is likely to see significant updates on the progress of negotiations,"" it said.

IPEF is structured around four pillars relating to trade, supply chains, clean economy, and fair economy (issues like tax and anti-corruption). India has joined the three pillars except the trade part.

Talks are already concluded on the supply chain resilience and the process for domestic approval in India for this agreement is underway.

Officials of the member nations are holding talks on clean economy and fair economy pillars. The member countries have an option to decide the pillar in which they wish to participate. India has opted out from the trade pillar, while it has joined the remaining three.

The member countries are holding negotiations to sign separate agreements on these subjects. Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the US and Vietnam are members of the bloc.

Goyal will also hold bilateral meetings with the US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai, and Ministers from other IPEF partner countries on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting.

""These meetings will focus on addressing trade barriers, promoting investments, and fostering greater cooperation in areas such as technology and innovation,"" the ministry said.

He would be representing India at the IPEF Leaders' Meeting and the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) - IPEF Investor Forum meeting on November 16, 2023.

The APEC Economic Leaders Engagements will be on 15-16, 2023. India has been invited as a guest economy.

One of the key focus areas of the visit will be the joint event, co-chaired with Raimondo on ""India-USA Innovation Handshake Initiative"", with the aim to lift up and connect the two sides' dynamic startup ecosystems, address specific regulatory hurdles to cooperation, and promote further innovation and job growth, particularly in emerging technologies.

Goyal will participate in the investors' roundtable along with one-to-one meetings with CEOs, besides interacting with various stakeholders such as students, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and Indian diaspora.

""Goyal is expected to interact with globally renowned technology, entrepreneurship, and academic communities in the Bay Area, specifically, in the Silicon Valley to undertake focused discussions with American companies looking to invest or expand in India across sectors - Electronics (including Semiconductor), Technology, FinTech,"" it added."

The meeting took place ahead of the fifth edition of the India-US 2+2 Defence and Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue .

“Pleased to meet with Secretary of State @SecBlinken this morning. An open and productive conversation on further developing our strategic partnership,” Jaishankar posted on X.

""This visit has a particular significance because we need to follow up on PM Modi's June visit and President Biden's September visit. This is a 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue, so we take a broader view of what we are doing.""

The Minister said that he also spoke about West Asia, Indo-Pacific and other regional issues.

He underscored the comprehensive nature of the discussions, particularly the Indo-Pacific as members of the QUAD (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) and ongoing conflict in West Asia, calling it a “big concern”.

India is part of the Quad alliance with the US, Australia and Japan that aims to counter China’s aggressive posturing in the Indo-Pacific region.

""It is always wonderful to be here in India. We are building a remarkable year of engagement. We have not only the strongest bilateral partnership we've ever had, but also a regional one, and indeed, a global one that was further evidenced by India's leadership for the G20 this year,"" Blinken said after meeting Jaishankar.

""We have a lot to do, including with our defence colleagues. I think it's further evidence of our resolute focus for the US on the Indo-Pacific, our region for the future, the future is actually now, and we're building it together with India,"" he said.

Jaishankar and Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will hold the annual 2+2India-US talks with Blinken and US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin who arrived in Delhi on Thursday.

The two countries are working on deals for the US to supply and manufacture engines for Indian fighter jets, MQ-9 predator drones and semiconductor manufacturing, according to sources.

The talks are expected to build on the discussions that have already taken place in this regard during Modi’s visit to Washington in June and President Joe Biden's trip for the G20 summit in September.

From leading a record-breaking yoga event at the United Nations to forging important defence and semiconductor production deals, PM Modi's trip showcased India's cultural heritage, diplomatic prowess, and its growing influence on the world stage.

There are five important takeaways from PM Modi’s US visit that one can immediately think of, besides tons of memorable moments and gestures that will remain etched in the evolving timeline of the friendship between the two nations.

Manifesting India's cultural and spiritual leadership

PM Modi leading 177 nations in performing yoga at the United Nations on International Yoga Diwas was a historic moment, reminiscent of Swami Vivekananda's impactful speech at the World Congress of Religions in 1893. By spearheading the global embrace of India's ancient science, yoga, PM Modi not only demonstrated the country's cultural and spiritual leadership but also reinforced the concept of India as a ""spiritual democracy"". This concept encompasses the country's rich spiritual heritage, where diverse religious and philosophical beliefs coexist harmoniously within a democratic framework and without any discrimination.

The event not only showcased the physical and mental benefits of yoga but also highlighted India's commitment to promoting holistic well-being and inner harmony. By engaging a record number of nations in this practice, PM Modi underscored India's potential to serve as a guiding light for spiritual enlightenment and self-discovery in a world grappling with various challenges.

Countering toxic rhetoric and fostering unity

During his visit, PM Modi effectively dismantled the toxic rhetoric that democracy is in danger and that Muslims are unsafe in India. In his eloquent speech to the Senate, he emphasised India's longstanding commitment to democratic values and inclusivity. His words resonated with the audience, receiving 15 standing ovations, even from individuals with differing political ideologies. By highlighting India's pluralistic society and its respect for the rights and safety of all citizens, regardless of their religious or cultural background, PM Modi showcased India's strength as a nation that upholds the principles of democracy and fosters unity in diversity.

Strengthening defence and semiconductor production deals

The most significant economic achievements of PM Modi's visit were the strategic defence and semiconductor production deals signed between India and the US. These agreements not only enhance India's defence capabilities but also solidify its position as a reliable partner for advanced technology collaborations. The defence partnership aims to bolster India's security infrastructure and foster stronger military ties with the US. This cooperation reflects the growing trust and mutual interests shared by the two nations in maintaining regional stability and countering common security challenges.

Furthermore, the semiconductor production deals signify India's aspirations to become a global manufacturing hub for advanced technologies. By attracting investments and establishing semiconductor manufacturing units, India aims to reduce its dependence on imports and contribute to the global supply chain. These agreements align with PM Modi's vision of fostering innovation and technological advancement in India, thereby boosting economic growth and creating employment opportunities.

Moving beyond China and asserting regional dominance

US President Joe Biden's bold stance against the Chinese establishment, labelling it as a dictatorship, signifies the strengthening Indo-US axis. The increased strategic engagement between India and the US indicates a shared objective to diminish China's influence in the region and establish dominance in the Indian Ocean. This collaborative approach between the two nations aims to ensure peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, thereby positioning India as a key player in shaping the region's future.

India's strategic location and its growing economic and military capabilities make it an important partner for the US in maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. The focus on regional cooperation and security aligns with India's ‘Act East’ policy.

US knows Modi will be back in 2024

Finally, why would the US invest so lavishly in India when general elections are just a few months away? That’s because the US, through its multiple intelligence sources, is convinced PM Modi will retain the PM’s post handsomely.

India, with its age-old virtuous concepts of Ram Rajya and Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, was always supposed to be the world’s biggest spiritual democracy, which it is now seen as. Its population of 140 crore is the country’s biggest capital. India, in 2047, will be in a different league, thanks to the unprecedented growth impetus generated by PM Modi.

The Joe Biden’s administration rolled out its full pageantry for the Indian leader during the three-day visit. At a joint press conference with PM Modi, President Biden called this a new era in the US-India relationship. He exuded that the partnership is “stronger, closer and more dynamic than at any time in history” and that the economic relationship is “booming.”

The fact that trade between the two countries has more than doubled over the past decade underscores President Biden’s point. Despite all the pomp and pageantry of a state dinner and PM Modi’s address to the US Congress, it can be said that this visit wasn’t just about optics.

The two sides came to an agreement on a long list of deliverables spanning defence, critical and emerging technology, and space cooperation. The deals on defence and semiconductors in particular are aimed at countering China’s growing hegemony.

Let us take a look at all the deals and its impact on India’s status as an emerging power.

PM Modi’s US visit defence deals

General Electric (GE) has signed an agreement with India’s Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) to jointly manufacture engines, which will power fighter jets of the Indian Air Force. This historic deal is the most significant deliverable of PM Modi’s visit as the US is willing to give India access to cutting-edge jet engine technology, which it rarely shares. The GE engine in question is the F414, the workhorse for US Navy’s fighter jets.

The F414 engine will power India’s next-generation Tejas 2. India will also procure the deadly armed version of MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. These drones will significantly enhance India’s surveillance capabilities along the border with China in the Himalayan heights and in the Indian Ocean.

Boost to India’s domestic chip sector

India is looking to become a semiconductor powerhouse as US is encouraging American chipmakers to decrease their dependence on China. So, there were deals in this sphere as well.

US rchipmaker Micron Technology will invest more than $800 million towards a new $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and testing plant, to be built in Gujarat.

Applied Materials has announced that it will build a Semiconductor Centre for commercialisation and innovation in India in order to diversify its semiconductor supply chain.

PM Modi’s US visit: Big move on US visas

The Biden administration has announced that it will make it easier for skilled Indian workers to get and renew US visas. A pilot program to renew visas domestically for certain petition-based temporary workers will be introduced. This essentially means that applicants will not have to travel outside to get their renewal stamp. This program could be expanded to include H1B and L skilled visas by 2024.

India-US Space cooperation and Artemis Accords

India has joined the US-led Artemis Accords on space exploration. Also, India’s space agency ISRO will work with NASA towards a joint mission to the International Space Station in 2024.

Geopolitical messaging of PM Modi’s US visit

The US is trying to position India as a bulwark to China’s growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific. The Pentagon is also aiming to wean India off Russian arms. The deals that were signed during PM Modi’s US visit will enhance India’s role as a major player in the region and boost India's standing in the world."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India will receive a lavish welcome on Thursday in Washington, where he will address a joint session of Congress and be feted by President Biden and the first lady in a state dinner at the White House — only the third state leader to be hosted by the current administration.

Swirling around the pageantry of a momentous visit for U.S.-India relations, seen as an affirmation of India’s rise as an economic and diplomatic power, will be weighty questions of geopolitical alignments with regard to China’s economic influence and Russia’s military aggression, as well as the erosion of India’s secular democracy under Mr. Modi. How much if any of that will be publicly addressed by the two leaders is unclear.

The visit is a significant diplomatic prize for Mr. Modi, who was once denied a visa to the United States for his role in religious riots in his home state, and as prime minister has increasingly consolidated power and edged his country closer to one-party rule."

Several prominent figures from India's business community have expressed optimism about the outcomes of the visit and its potential impact on India's economy.

Ashish Chauhan, CEO of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), acknowledged the positive effects of PM Modi's visit on the Indian stock market. Chauhan said, “Nifty touched 19,000 today, and it is a great moment for India. But it is also a reflection of Mr. Modi's visit to US and the outcomes.""

He recalled that India was never part of the strategy orbit of US or western countries but now the United States is considering India as a partner in cutting-edge technologies such as 5G, 6G, quantum computing, space exploration, and other high-end tech fields.

Sanjay Nayar, former CEO of KKR India Partner, expressed his optimism regarding the emerging positive partnerships in the tech sector as a result of PM Modi's visit. One of the key strategic moves highlighted by Nayar was the Prime Minister's outreach to companies, policy-makers, and think-tanks.

“He had really been pragmatic and practical and there is obviously an equation that is there between Indian and the US people, but more than that his personal zeal and zest to go reach out to diverse set of people I think it is building a different kind of bond and frankly these kind of technologies come to you only when you have a huge amount of trust and understanding between each other.”

Additionally, Nayar noted that the Indian government's substantial investments in infrastructure are driving both investment and consumption, which, in turn, contribute to economic growth. He concluded by stating his expectations of Indian markets continuing to rise as more investments and increased consumption fuel growth.

Nilesh Shah, Managing Director of Kotak Mutual Fund, highlighted the positive sentiment towards India following PM Modi's visit to the USA. Shah stated, “Sentiment is positive towards India because there is hardly any country which has as strong macroeconomic foundation as India has today.”

While the stock markets may have reached all-time highs, Shah noted that valuations are not necessarily at all-time highs. Comparatively, Indian valuations are only slightly higher than those of its competitors, leaving room for further growth.

However, Shah emphasised the importance of India delivering on its promises of superior governance standards and green transformation to sustain the positive.

“Today investors are paying premium to enter India because they expect 3G from India - growth, governance and green transformation. As long as India delivers on this 3G I think our markets and economy both will do well.”"
100,https://thewire.in/security/modi-us-visit-security-vulnerability,Modi’s US Visit Has Increased India’s Vulnerabilities,,"Geopolitical rivalry with China has brought India and the US into the tight strategic embrace which was on ample display during the recent state visit to Washington of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The US needs India for global geopolitics while India wants the US for regional geopolitics.

The only problem is that the US, having identified China as its sole geopolitical competitor in this century – with the capability to match it in economy, technology, diplomacy, and military – has failed to accept that its deterrence (military power) model of the Cold War is unsuitable against the Chinese geopolitical model, which is based more on global cooperation for prosperity than military power alone.

Even in a fragmented world, the Chinese model cannot fail. Changing the game from free trade to weaponised trade by ‘decoupling’ or ‘de-risking’ value chains and supply chain networks from dependence on China – still the world’s biggest trading partner – will only add to geopolitical tensions with the global economy heading towards recession.

Unmindful of the disastrous fall-out of the Ukraine war on the global economic order led by the US dollar, the reluctance of its regional allies to openly confront China and the own recent experience of its top diplomat being lectured by Chinese supremo Xi Jinping, the US has decided to bet on India to build it as a military bulwark against China in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

The long-term bet is based on the assumption that Prime Minister Modi will win the 2024 general elections and will not normalise India’s relations with China in this decade — the time it would take for deliverables promised by each side to take shape. The other assumption is that, if push comes to shove, India, as claimed by its political and military leadership, will be able to take on the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in a border war.

Ironically, the huge jubilation in India regarding the Modi visit missed the point that under the new transactional arrangement, India would end up giving far more, including its strategic autonomy, than it will get in return – which will be further accentuated by the US’s irrepressible urge (as seen during the 2005-2008 civil nuclear deal negotiations) to shift the goalposts.

The US agenda

So, what does the US want from India?

It wants commonality of military equipment by slowly weaning India (the largest arms importer in the world) away from Russia, its traditional, affordable, and trusted partner. It wants to improve Indian naval dockyards to serve as temporary military bases for its assets (vessels of all hue, including nuclear submarines and carriers) in the IOR. It also wants the Indian military (especially the navy) to do advanced exercises bilaterally and multi-laterally with the Quad navies for developing interoperability for combat in the IOR, which India considers its backwaters. Since the character of war has changed with new-age technologies, the US wants to pull up the technological level of the Indian military through the newly crafted India-United States Defence Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X), which is part of the bigger Innovation on Critical and Emerging Technologies (ICET) framework whereby it will be able to operate within the US Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) defence network under its ‘integrated deterrence’ strategy by the end of this decade.

All this has become possible as India (which is neither a military ally nor a non-NATO ally) has signed the US military’s four foundational agreements which qualify it to be part of the US’s new age networks. Thus, by 2030, India will fulfil all the requirements for interoperability: commonality of equipment, advanced military exercises, combat support facilities like MROs (maintenance, repair, operations) from the US, and familiarity with various war contingencies in the IOR.

Moreover, as part of iCET, India will adopt US rules, regulatory, norms, and standards in the new age fourth industrial technologies for trade and commerce since US companies will have first user advantage in India. Thus, given the certainty of the splinternet (bifurcation of the Internet and the value supply chains) based on US and Chinese technologies, India will get strategically isolated from its South Asian neighbours, all of which are onboard the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative), which will be based on the Chinese internet by 2030.

GE engines and technology transfer

Let’s now examine the deals individually, starting with General Electric’s memorandum of understanding with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).

According to the GE press release, it will deliver 99 F-414 engines for Indian Air Force (IAF) Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mk2 programme. GE will also help with the ‘prototype development, testing, and certification of the AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft) programme with its F-414-INS6 engine’. Moreover, GE will provide 99 F-404 engines for the LCA Mk1 programme. Both GE engines (F-404 and F-414) have already been part of the development of LCA Mk1 and LCA Mk2 programmes.

Three observations are in order. One, there will be no transfer of technology (ToT) of turbofan and casting technologies and even metallurgy formulae which make up almost 95 per cent of the engine’s Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs). It stands to logic that GE, which has spent huge amounts of time, resources, and talent creating the engine, cannot hand over its IPRs to India and create a competitor for itself. All India will get is engine assembly rights (called indigenous production in India), like we have for Russian AL-31FP engines for the Su-30MKI, which are being made in Koraput since 2004. The remaining five per cent ToT which includes tools for engine maintenance may be allowed by GE after the US Congress clears it. Thus, the IAF will be saddled with the burden of maintaining yet another engine besides British, Russian, and French.

Two, the US will make a strong bid for the IAF’s urgent operational need of 114 fighter jets under the Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) and the Indian Navy’s carrier-borne fighter programmes, in both of which Boeing’s Super Hornet, powered by GE-F414 engines, is a contender. Cheaper than the Rafale, the Super Hornet has been in US military service since 1999 with various upgrades. The IAF will be saddled with one more fighter, when it wants to reduce its types of combat aircraft. The Super Hornet, if it comes to the IAF and the Indian Navy, will be Prime Minister Modi’s choice rather than the Services’ Headquarters, which favours Rafale.

Three, while care will be taken by the Indian side to make an impregnable legal case against US sanctions on GE F-414, the US is not known to care much for legalities. A case in point is the freedom of navigation patrols by US Navy vessels in the South China Sea (SCS) and Taiwan Strait citing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) when the US has not even ratified the universal convention.

Why drones are no big deal

Regarding drones, India has agreed to buy 31 General Atomics (GA) MQ-9B (Sea Guardian and Sky Guardian) armed and unarmed drones under Foreign Military Sales (FMS) for the price of approximately US$3 billion. The offset amount of this deal will be used by GA to establish an MRO facility in India. These drones (also called Predators and Reapers) are extremely expensive, slow-moving, and completely out of sync with present and future trends in warfare. On the positive side, these drones carry big payloads, and have good range and mission capability since they are equipped with electro-optic video cameras, laser designators, good communication relay with ground stations, good electromagnetic systems, and signal intelligent equipment. They also have endurance of 40 hours. On the downside, with slow speed they are vulnerable and can be shot down by enemy air defence systems. Moreover, they lack autonomy (AI), are not stealthy and, most of all, require a lot of people on the ground to operate them.

In his book Army of None, US analyst Paul Scharre writes, ‘Predator and Reaper drone operations require seven to ten pilots to staff one drone orbit of 24/7 continuous around-the-clock coverage over an area. Another 20 people per orbit are required to operate the sensors on the drone, and scores of intelligence analysts are needed to sift through the sensor data. In fact, because of these substantial personnel requirements, the US Air Force has a strong resistance to calling these aircraft unmanned.’

The irony is that when these UAVs had a lucrative market in the early 2000s, US laws did not allow their sale. Now, when the US has approved their export, many more cost-effective and better-performing drones with AI options are available. Incidentally, China is a leading exporter of military drones. There can only be two reasons for India buying these outdated and expensive drones: US pressure and the Indian military’s tendency to conflate capability with sophisticated weapon platforms.

What iCET and INDUS-X really represent

The US pressure for this purchase is for its Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) under the Indo-Pacific partnership which was announced in Tokyo in 2022. Under this, the Quad members are to do data collection and sharing of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) feeds with partners in Southeast Asia and Pacific nations. India, given its location, has a special responsibility which is evident from two things: It is the only country which has operational interaction with three US theatre commands namely, INDOPACOM, Central Command, and Africa Command. And the Indian Navy’s Gurgaon-based Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC), whose software has been supplied by US companies CISCO and Raytheon, will be the nerve centre of the MDA project. To keep data cyber-secure, new undersea cables will be laid connecting all Quad members.

To understand the iCET framework and the INDUS-X scheme – which have been touted as the biggest US offering to India since the civil-nuclear deal – it is essential to first understand the context. Following the 2012 discovery of Deep Learning which revolutionised AI, and conscious that most emerging technologies including AI were being incubated in the commercial sector, the Pentagon in 2015 opened its outpost called Defence Innovation Unit (DIU) in Silicon Valley. Staffed with mostly civilian software experts and a few retired and active-duty military officers, the DIU was to help identify advanced commercial technologies for military use.

Taking a cue from the Pentagon’s DIU, the Indian defence ministry, in April 2018, launched the Innovation for Defence Excellence (iDEX) scheme under the defence secretary for incubation of new age technologies development in defence and aerospace from within the industry, start-ups, civilian laboratories, academia and so on. Unfortunately, iDEX has not delivered for four reasons: it is headed by bureaucrats with little domain knowledge, many start-ups that get good funding are owned by former military officers with questionable links in the system, deserving start-ups with few resources are bought by the Defence Research and Development Organisation, and projects are time-bound, which stymies creativity, ideas, and innovations.

Worse, there is little clarity on new-age commercial technologies prioritisation and how to harness them for military use. For instance, there are 20 advanced commercial technologies to choose from for military use. These are AI (where all new age technologies converge), 5G wireless and advanced networking, sensors with edge computing, Internet of Things, biotechnology, robotics and autonomy, semiconductors, blockchain, virtual reality (for simulation), metaverse, star-link internet, natural languages processing, space, cyber, advanced manufacturing, energy storage technologies, quantum computing, brain-computer interface, genomics, and exoskeletons.

Meanwhile, aware that talent is the most important pillar of AI alongside data, hardware (microelectronics), and software (algorithms), and with many talented Chinese AI researchers leaving the US for China following the tech war, the US, which attracts talent from across the world (mostly Chinese and Indians) to remain the global innovation hub, seemed to be losing the competition for talent to China.

Against this backdrop, the Indian and US National Security Advisors met in January 2023 to launch the ICET framework to be the bridge between commercial and defence sectors. Under the ICET, the two sides launched the INDUS-X scheme chaired jointly by the Pentagon and India’s iDEX to identify Indian defence start-ups which will work with the US start-ups organised by the civilian US-India Business Council (USIBC) to design, prototype, test, and produce commercial technologies with application in ‘integrated deterrence’ network. While in theory, the money for identified start-ups will come from a joint development fund, in practice they will be funded by the Pentagon. This way, the US military will be able to match, if not beat, the PLA’s 2035 deadline of robotic war (called intelligentised war) and make up for its talent shortage using Indian researchers to meet the Chinese challenge of becoming the world’s primary AI innovation centre by 2030.

It is for this reason that the US is easing H1B and L1 visas procedures for Indian STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) graduates and research scholars to work in the US. This is a good thing for Indian scholars and start-ups who will gain knowledge by working in world-class innovation hubs. Of course, it would have been better if the Indian civilian start-ups could work directly with the DIU (instead of through the iDEX and the Pentagon) for the understanding of all advanced commercial technologies.

However, for India which prided itself on its strategic autonomy in foreign policy, allowing Indian shipyards to emerge ‘as a hub for maintenance and repair of forward deployed (in the IOR) US navy assets (navy ships and naval fighters)’ is too big a price to pay for Modi’s rousing welcome in the US. Taking forward the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Understanding (LEMOA) signed by the Modi government in 2016, which allowed re-fuelling and other turn-around facilities to the US naval assets on a case-to-case basis, the present arrangement will permit the US to upgrade Indian shipyards to berth US warships for long periods. Shorn of rhetoric, India has agreed to provide military basing to the US military.

The impact on China

The big question now is: How will China assess India’s tight embrace of the US? China will conclude that normalisation of relations with the Modi government will not be possible since India has sacrificed its strategic autonomy to accommodate US military interests in the IOR.

Worse, India has become the US’s first line of offence against Chinese interests and infrastructure in the South Asian region (by denouncing its Belt and Road Initiative as a debt trap). Moreover, in cahoots with the US, India will be seen to threaten China’s commerce and trade worth over US$4 trillion annually which passes through the 3,000 nautical miles IOR from the Strait of Hormuz to the Strait of Malacca. This, at a time when the Chinese deterrence in the IOR is a decade away.

Xi Jinping’s directive to the PLA was to prepare capabilities (deterrence) to meet the (US) challenge in West Pacific and the Indian border by 2027, and across Asia Pacific (including IOR) by 2035. The PLA has already achieved deterrence (and capabilities to fight if deterrence failed) ahead of its timeline in the West Pacific and is working on the entire region.

China’s deterrence in the West Pacific where it faces challenges in the Taiwan Strait and the South and East China Sea is based on the combination of its military power and economic power (its intense trade with ASEAN and US allies like Japan and South Korea). Given the advantage of its geography, and the formidable Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) firewall that the PLA has created against the US, China refused Antony Blinken’s request in Beijing for opening bilateral military communication to avert a crisis in the region. While the stated reason by China for doing this are the US sanctions on its defence minister, Gen. Li Shangfu, the actual reason is to discourage US freedom of navigation and air patrols in the waters and air space in the Chinese backyard. Much in line with the US’s Monroe Doctrine – which disallows the presence of outside powers in the Western hemisphere – China wants US military activities in West Pacific to end.

Meanwhile, aware of its eroded deterrence in the West Pacific, the US military is reinforcing its regional alliances, seeking a global role for NATO and strengthening its military bases in Hawaii and Guam.

Chinese deterrence outside the West Pacific will be based on its economic deterrence anchored on BRICS and BRI, and its military deterrence anchored on the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and cooperative security with nations onboard the BRI. Since prosperity is at the vanguard of the BRI, Xi Jinping has announced that the third BRI Forum will be held in Beijing this year. The actual dates of the Forum perhaps await progress on Xi’s pet project of ‘Xiongan (meaning brave and peaceful) New Area’, 100km outside Beijing which is being called the vice-capital of China. Named the ‘plan of a thousand years’ by Xi, this city, meant to de-congest Beijing by moving many governments, financial, medical, academic, and military headquarters here, is being built with cyberspace software connectivity (part of the Digital Silk Road, a sub-set of the BRI) using industrial internet technologies like blockchain, 5G, IoT, big data and so on. This smart city will become the blockchain hub in China with blockchain-based services. Given this, it will be a good idea for Xi to showcase this smart city close to Beijing to the Forum delegates for them to get a sense of how the new phase of BRI (cyberspace software connectivity) which will likely figure in Xi’s address, would usher in prosperity by industrial internet.

China’s economic deterrence for BRI nations will get delayed owing to the chip war with the US. For example, China has been denied advanced chips which are required in AI and data centres for computing, storage, and for servers. Slowing economic deterrence will affect military deterrence which is based on cooperative security (PLA working with host BRI nation’s security forces for the protection of Chinese infrastructure, interests, and people).

Given the likelihood of China’s military deterrence lagging behind the US – which is supported now by India in South Asia and the IOR – Beijing might decide to up the ante on its border. Since China sees the boundary problem with India as a dispute regarding its sovereignty, it may decide to upend the US’s growing integrated deterrence in the region by a short and decisive war with India. In that sense, Modi’s US embrace has increased India’s vulnerabilities.

The most significant tangible gain from the visit may be the deal signed between India’s Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) and American industrial giant GE to jointly produce GE’s jet engine F414 for HAL’s upgraded light combat aircraft, Tejas Mk 2. Under the deal, GE will increase the transfer of technologies that go into making jet engines from the original 58%, which was agreed to in the 2012 deal, to 80%. Some vital parts will continue to be made in the US and supplied to HAL.

The deal will boost India’s capability to produce versatile warplanes, a vital component of the power India seeks to project as a dominant force in the Indo-Pacific region. As part of this plan, India recently gifted to Vietnam an in-service corvette. Bristling with myriad guns, it is also capable of launching missiles, making it an ideal addition to Vietnam’s coastal protection forces in a region where China’s coast guard, navy and fishing fleets seek to establish dominance.

Vietnam of course has a history of standing up to and prevailing over the original colonial power, France, and later the United States. In 1978 it occupied Cambodia, then ruled by the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge, and ended its genocidal rule. China wanted Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia and, to drive the point home, attacked the country in early 1979. Vietnam repulsed the attack, giving China what is generally described as a bloody nose. Vietnam remained in Cambodia till 1989, receiving little help from an unraveling Soviet Union. Prising China from the USSR’s grasp was America’s defining victory in its campaign against Communism after World War II.

This potted history is relevant to understanding why India is a vital ally for the US in the emerging world, in which America considers China a systemic rival and seeks to contain its fast-growing strategic capabilities. India has, since 2002, been the world’s third-largest economy in purchasing-power-parity terms, and continues to grow quickly. It has a running border dispute with China, which the northern neighbour is unwilling to settle. India is also the world’s largest importer of defence equipment, which shows its determination to shore up its forces and its receptivity to external supply of military kit and technology.

India has the heft — economic, technological and military — to become a counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific region. It can accommodate new supply chains the US needs to diversify from China. India is perceived by countries of the Indo-Pacific as a non-threatening counterweight to China. Its joint exploration with Vietnam of potential offshore oil and gas fields, and its gift of a naval ship to that country hint at the possible roles India could play in the region.

It was in recognition of this potential that the Bush administration worked hard to give India a nuclear deal, which the Manmohan Singh government staked its survival to defend. It was because of the continued recognition of this potential that President Obama described Indo-American ties “the defining partnership of the 21st century"" during Singh’s state visit in 2009. Subsequent developments have only deepened that recognition in the US, which explains the desire of both Republican and Democratic regimes to improve ties with India.

The importance of securing India’s cooperation in preventing Chinese dominance of the Indo-Pacific allows the country to maintain a neutral stand on Ukraine and obtain concessions from the US without giving up any of its cooperation with Russia – whether on buying an advanced missile defence system or providing a market for the oil that finances Russia’s war on Ukraine.

The Indian-American community’s economic success, which makes it a growing force not just in universities, think tanks and the media but also in politics and governance puts pressure on the US to maintain good relations with New Delhi. Tiny Ireland and even tinier Israel have had an outsize impact on US presidents for similar reasons.

Modi’s visit to the US enhances India’s geopolitical salience and improves global – not just American – business confidence in the Indian economy. The specific deals that have been signed or promised reflect this reality."
102,http://www.ipcs.org/comm_select.php?articleNo=5061,Implications of Modi’s US Visit,,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s fourth visit to the US and second meeting with US President Barack Obama at the White House had not raised heightened expectations, and thus, the outcome of his visit also failed to generate much excitement in either India or the US.



The main event that drew the attention of the Indian media was his address to the joint session of the US Congress. It is difficult to extract any aspect of his speech or statements to highlight any newness in the emphasis or novel initiative. What accounts for little anticipations from Modi’s recent visit to the US and tiny excitement over the outcome after his visit?



Firstly, Prime Minister Modi has already met the US president multiple times and it was to be yet another round of interactions. Secondly, his first visit to the US after assuming office as the Indian prime minister was already spectacular both in terms of optics and substance. And nothing more could have been expected in just about two years. Thirdly, his initiative to invite President Obama to be the Chief Guest at the Republic Day celebration also indicated both his innovative diplomacy and coherent efforts to effect a deeper cooperation between the US and India.



All that needed to be said had already been said in last two years and this time the visit perhaps meant to reinforce the mutual commitment to implement the measures agreed upon. Many believed that it was not prudent to visit the US to speak with an outgoing president and especially at a time when that nation was acutely engrossed in an election year. But such an argument is fallacious. Regular interactions at the highest levels of government undoubtedly have value-addition; and especially since the two countries have begun a journey along a new trajectory in their bilateral relationship in the midst of a difficult transition in the global political economy and subtle power shift. Moreover, Modi did not yet have an opportunity to directly engage with a powerful component of the US federal government, whereas President Obama had addressed the Indian parliament during one of his visits. That gap has been desirably filled with this visit.



The principal question that needs to be examined is whether Modi’s recent visit would have any substantial impact on the US’ policy towards South Asia. What were the major points raised by the Indian prime minister during his recent visit to the US? First, he expressed his desire to elevate the level of economic and technological cooperation between the two countries. India’s economic performance in the backdrop of a slow recovery of the global economy from recession, and the Modi government’s ambitious economic agendas to develop India’s infrastructure to fit the 21st Century global standard; create one hundred smart cities; and improve rural-urban connectivity through digitisation; certainly provide a great opportunity to expand Indo-US economic cooperation.



Secondly, Prime Minister Modi reiterated his idea of more robust Indo-US cooperation to fight global terror whose incubation takes place in India’s neighbourhood. Here, one may say that the two countries have been making some combined efforts to combat terrorism for long, but the nature of engagement between Washington and Islamabad has and will continue to set the limits. So long as the US forces are present on the Afghan soil, Pakistan will remain a relevant security partner of Washington’s. No matter, who enters the White House after the upcoming November election, expecting more than what already is the level of cooperation between New Delhi and Washington would be like building castles in the air. Pakistan seems to be a necessary evil that no US government can close its eye on.



While the US apparently is seeking closer security ties with India in the emerging context of escalating challenges from enlargement of the Chinese sphere of influence in South and Central Asia, it remains to be seen how India and the US actually collaborate extensively in the economic sphere. China’s economic footprint in Pakistan has been enlarging and the promised implementation of Sino-Pakistan economic corridor will further strengthen Beijing’s influence in South Asia. This in combination with Chinese economic presence in other smaller countries in South Asia do pose a long term security risk to the US’ influence in this region. Unless the US considers this aspect and seeks to enhance its economic involvement in this region, its single-minded effort to forge defence and security partnership with India will be inadequate to maintain a regional balance.



The Indo-US strategic partnership at present seems heavily loaded in favour of defence and security ties. There is no need for course correction, but greater economic and technological focus is necessary to make it more balanced. Modi’s reemphasis in the US on enhanced economic cooperation is thus a welcome development."

Charting a Technology Partnership for the Future



2. Prime Minister Modi and President Biden affirm that technology will play the defining role in deepening our partnership. The leaders hailed the inauguration of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) in January 2023 as a major milestone in India-U.S relations. They called on our governments, businesses, and academic institutions to realize their shared vision for the strategic technology partnership. The leaders recommitted the United States and India to fostering an open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystem, based on mutual confidence and trust that reinforces our shared values and democratic institutions.



3. Prime Minister Modi and President Biden set a course to reach new frontiers across all sectors of space cooperation. The leaders applauded our growing cooperation on earth and space science, and space technologies. They welcomed the decision of NASA and ISRO to develop a strategic framework for human spaceflight cooperation by the end of 2023.The leaders hailed the announcement by NASA to provide advanced training to Indian astronauts at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, with a goal of mounting a joint effort to the International Space Station in 2024.The leaders celebrated the delivery of the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite to ISRO’s U.R. Rao Satellite Centre in Bengaluru, India, and looked forward to NISAR’s 2024 launch from India. Welcoming India’s Space Policy – 2023, the leaders called for enhanced commercial collaboration between the U.S. and Indian private sectors in the entire value chain of the space economy and to address export controls and facilitate technology transfer. President Biden deeply appreciated India’s signing of the Artemis Accords, which advance a common vision of space exploration for the benefit of all humankind.



4. Prime Minister Modi and President Biden committed their administrations to promoting policies and adapting regulations that facilitate greater technology sharing, co-development, and co-production opportunities between U.S. and Indian industry, government, and academic institutions. The leaders welcomed the launch of the interagency-led Strategic Trade Dialogue in June2023 and directed both sides to undertake regular efforts to address export controls, explore ways of enhancing high technology commerce, and facilitate technology transfer between the two countries.



5.

With a shared commitment to democratic values, the US and India are set to deepen their cooperation across various sectors, from trade to technology and from security to climate change. The visit is set to bolster economic ties and strengthen diplomatic relations.

One of the key deals likely to be announced is the $1.8 billion deal for 18 Predator-B armed drones. These drones can long-range precision strikes and surveillance along borders and maritime areas. India and the US are also close to signing a military deal that would allow them to jointly develop fighter jet engines. Massachusetts-based aerospace manufacturing giant General Electric Co. (GE) will join hands with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. to produce the engines for the Tejas light-combat aircraft.

Watch this report: × On June 22, Modi will also address a joint session of the US Congress, becoming the sixth Indian Prime Minister to do so. While the Democrats and Republicans disagree on most of the issues, the two political rivals got together to send a bipartisan invite to Modi to address the joint meeting of Congress.

Modi's visit comes at a time when India and the US are facing multiple challenges as well as opportunities in a rapidly changing world. The two countries have forged a close strategic partnership over the years, based on shared values and interests. They have cooperated on various global issues, such as combating terrorism, promoting democracy and human rights, advancing clean energy and fighting COVID-19.

The visit will also bring into focus the growing people-to-people ties between the two countries, especially among the youth and diaspora. The US is home to over four million Indian Americans, who have made significant contributions to various sectors. Modi enjoys high popularity among them and has addressed several large gatherings of them during his previous visits.

The two countries have had a long cultural and intellectual exchange history since the late 19th century. One of the earliest examples was Swami Vivekananda's visit to America in 1893. As a young monk, he introduced Hinduism to the US at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago. He delivered a landmark speech celebrating toleration and universal acceptance of all religions.

Since then, many Indian leaders have visited the US and many American presidents have visited India. Some of these visits have been memorable for their impact on bilateral relations and global affairs.

- India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's visit to Washington in 1949 marked the beginning of diplomatic ties between independent India and the US. -Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. visited India in 1959 for a month-long tour. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violent struggle for national independence, King said said 'Non-violence is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity.'

- Dwight Eisenhower's visit to New Delhi in 1959 was the first by a US president to India and boosted cooperation on agriculture and development. He also addressed the Indian parliament. - John F. Kennedy's meeting with Indira Gandhi in Washington in 1961 laid the foundation for a strategic partnership on defence and security.

- Richard Nixon's visit to New Delhi in 1969 was marred by protests over his support for Pakistan during the Bangladesh conflict.

- Indira Gandhi's visit to Washington in 1982 revived ties after a period of estrangement due to India's nuclear test in 1974. -In 1978 U.S. President Jimmy Carter visited India on a three-day official trip. He visited a Gurugram village, Daulatpur Nasirabad, which was renamed Carterpuri.

- Bill Clinton's visit to India in 2000 was hailed as a watershed moment for transforming relations into a 'natural alliance'. - Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to Washington in 2000 declared that India and the US were 'natural allies' and signed a landmark civil nuclear deal. -In 2006 President George Bush visited India, where he and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh finalised the framework of the civil nuclear deal, boosting security and economic ties. -In 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama hosted the inaugural state visit of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. A visit which highlighted the growing bonhomie between New Delhi & Washington.

- A year later, Barack Obama's visit to India was historic as he became the first US president to attend the Republic Day parade as chief guest. These visits have shaped the India-US ties over the past seven decades and have reflected their changing priorities and challenges. Modi's visit in 2023 will be another landmark in this journey and will pave the way for a stronger and deeper partnership between the two countries. Prime Minister Modi will also interact with CEOs of leading American companies including FedEx, MasterCard and Adobe.

It will follow the official state dinner on June 22 at the White House with President Joe Biden - a celebration billed as a milestone in relations between the two democracies.

Indian Americans have also made their mark in politics, with several holding high positions in federal, state, and local governments. The most prominent example is Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the first person of Indian origin to hold such a post. Other notable Indian Americans include Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah, Congressman Ami Bera, Senator Raja Krishnamoorthi, Governor Nikki Haley, and Mayor Ravi Bhalla, among others.

Indian Americans have also been influential in shaping public opinion and discourse on various issues. They have been active in media, academia, think tanks, civil society organisations, and advocacy groups. They have also been vocal supporters of India-US relations and have played a bridging role between the two countries.

The three-day visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the United States from June 21 to 23 holds immense significance, not only for the bilateral relations between India and the USA but also for the global geopolitical landscape. This article will delve the importance of the visit, highlight the defence deals signed during the trip, and examine the impact on China as a result of the strengthening of India-US relations.

Significance and Importance of the Visit: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the USA signifies the deepening strategic partnership between the two nations. The trip aimed to strengthen diplomatic ties, enhance cooperation in various sectors, and reinforce the shared democratic values of India and the USA. It served as an opportunity to engage in high-level discussions on crucial global issues such as climate change, economic cooperation, and security challenges.

Defence Deals and Collaborations: During the visit, defence cooperation between India and the USA took centre stage. Several significant defence deals were signed, demonstrating the growing military partnership between the two countries. These deals not only bolster India's defence capabilities but also pave the way for increased defence technology transfers, joint exercises, and information sharing.

a. Defence Procurement: The visit witnessed the signing of defence procurement agreements, including the acquisition of advanced defence equipment from the USA. These procurements are expected to modernize India's defence infrastructure and enhance its defence preparedness. The big deals in the basket are Joint production F414 Jet engine by GE and HAL for Tejas Mark-1 aircraft and the acquisition of 31 MQ-9 Reaper Drones.

b. Technology and Research Collaboration: India and the USA also agreed to strengthen their collaboration in defence technology and research. This would facilitate joint research and development programs, defence innovation initiatives, and technology transfers. Such collaborations are crucial for both countries to address emerging security challenges effectively. The NSA's of both sides had an extensive discussion on the transfer of critical technology to India in New Delhi.

Impact on China: The growing India-US relations have a significant impact on China's geopolitical dynamics. Here are a few key aspects to consider:

a. Balancing China's Influence: The strengthening ties between India and the USA act as a significant counterbalance to China's growing influence in the region. As two major democratic powers, India and the USA aim to maintain a rules-based order, protect freedom of navigation, and promote stability in the Indo-Pacific region. This alignment of interests challenges China's regional ambitions and provides an alternative model of governance.

b. Economic Competition: The deepening India-US partnership poses economic challenges for China. With the focus on trade and investment, India and the USA can enhance their economic integration, reducing their dependence on Chinese markets. This can potentially impact China's economic growth and leverage.

c. Security Concerns: India's close defence cooperation with the USA serves as a deterrent to China's assertive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region. The sharing of intelligence, joint military exercises, and technology transfers enhance India's defence capabilities, making it a formidable force in countering potential threats.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's three-day visit to the USA holds immense significance in the context of India-US relations, defence cooperation, and its impact on China. The visit symbolizes the strengthening of ties between two democratic nations, marked by defence deals, technology collaborations, and shared strategic interests. As India and the USA deepen their partnership, China's regional influence faces challenges, both economically and in terms of security. The evolving dynamics between these nations will continue to shape the geopolitical landscape of the Indo-Pacific region in the years to come."

After seven years of an impactful partnership, as of September 11, 2020, Brookings India is now the Centre for Social and Economic Progress , an independent public policy institution based in India.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit New York and Washington, D.C. from September 27-30. This will be his first visit to the U.S. as leader of the world’s largest democracy and the first opportunity for the prime minister and President Barack Obama to meet. Modi will also engage with congressional leaders, the private sector and members of the Indian diaspora. The goal will be to build on the India-U.S. relationship, which has bilateral, regional and global dimensions. It also encompasses interaction in the fields of economics and trade, energy and climate change, cyber-governance, counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, and defense issues, as well as health and immigration.

On September 23, The India Project at Brookings hosted an event to preview the Modi visit and release a new Brookings policy brief “The Modi-Obama Summit: A Leadership Moment for India and the United States,” which contains over two dozen memos that provide an overview of the most important opportunities in the bilateral relationship and recommendations for next steps both governments should take. The panel discussion included Tanvi Madan, fellow and director of The India Project; Joshua Meltzer, fellow with the Global Economy and Development program; and Neil Ruiz, senior policy analyst and associate fellow in the Metropolitan Policy program. William Antholis, managing director of Brookings, moderated the discussion.

The panel was followed by a featured conversation on U.S.-India relations with Rep. Eliot Engel, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, moderated by Brookings President Strobe Talbott.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s State Visit to the United States will have “significant outcomes”, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on June 17.

Interacting with reporters on the sidelines of a function in New Delhi, he also said that it would be the first time that an Indian Prime Minister addressed the U.S. Congress twice.

Prime Minister Modi is visiting the U.S. from June 21-24 at the invitation of President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. They will host Modi at a State Dinner on June 22. The visit also includes an address to the Joint Session of the Congress on June 22.

“The Prime Minister is going on a State Visit, which signifies the highest level of honour. So, the honour that he will receive, has been accorded to a very few people, so far,” Mr. Jaishankar said after the function that was held at Badarpur in South Delhi as part of the BJP’s mega outreach campaign — ‘Sampark se Samarthan’ — intended to mark the completion of the nine years of the Modi government.

“The Prime Minister will address a Joint Session of the U.S. Congress. No Indian Prime Minister has addressed it twice. So, it will be the first time. The world over also, very few people have done that — Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela. So, there are very few people who have addressed the U.S. Congress twice,” Mr. Jaishankar said.

It assumes “huge importance” and outcomes will be seen later, the External Affairs Minister said.

Asked about the implications of the State Visit on India-U.S. relations, he said this State Visit will have “significant outcomes” and added that “what outcomes these will be, I cannot tell that right now”.

Prime Minister Modi will arrive in New York on June 20 and will lead the 9th International Yoga Day celebrations at the UN headquarters on June 21. He will then travel to Washington DC, where he will be welcomed by President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden on June 22 for the State Visit.

Asked what message this U.S. State Visit by Mr. Modi would send to China and Pakistan, the Union Minister said, “When a Prime Minister visits a country, it is to take our [India’s] relationship forward. I understand that it is a globalised world, so if something happens, it may or may not have an impact on others. We see it for our interests, from the perspective of our relations.”"

But he is shunned no more. On June 22, Washington will roll out the red carpet for Modi, who will become just the third world leader (after France’s Emmanuel Macron and South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol) to be invited by President Joe Biden for a state visit and dinner, the highest of diplomatic receptions typically reserved for only the closest of allies. That Biden has chosen to fete Modi in this way is indicative of the “deep and close partnership” between their two countries, the White House said in a statement, especially on matters of foreign policy. But it is perhaps also emblematic of the growing visibility and electoral heft of the Indian American community.

“Indian Americans are a key constituency and a key vote in a number of swing states,” says Sara Sadhwani, an assistant professor of politics at Pomona College and a senior researcher at AAPI Data, which publishes demographic data and policy research on Asian Americans.

With a population of nearly 5 million, Indian Americans are the second-largest immigrant group and fastest-growing voting bloc in the U.S. today. Their impact is evident at the ballot box, where Indian Americans voted in record numbers during the 2020 presidential election. It is also becoming increasingly apparent in the halls of power, from Congress (where there are five Indian American lawmakers currently serving, up from just one a decade ago) to the White House (where Kamala Harris, who is biracial, made history as the first Vice President of Indian heritage). While every presidential contest since 2016 has featured at least one Indian American candidate, 2024 is poised to be the first race to feature at least two: Nikki Hayley, the daughter of Sikh immigrants from Punjab, and Vivek Ramaswamy, whose parents hail from Kerala.

Modi’s enduring popularity among the diaspora

Doug Mills—The New York Times/Redux

The Indian American community’s political weight has not been lost on Modi, who has leveraged its influence time and again. When the Prime Minister first came to power in 2014, he was received by 20,000 spectators at a sold-out event in New York’s Madison Square Garden during a five-day visit to the U.S. It was the largest reception any foreign leader has received in the country after the Pope. “This is India’s century,” Modi declared, sending the wildly enthusiastic crowd into a frenzy.

In 2019, Modi once again received a jubilant reception with nearly 50,000 spectators at a “Howdy Modi” rally in Houston.

A survey on Indian American attitudes conducted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and YouGov in 2020 found that Indian Americans held broadly favorable views of Modi, with nearly half approving of his performance as Prime Minister. Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at Carnegie, says that this might be because the Indian diaspora sees Modi as “reclaiming India’s rightful status on the global scene.”

“India is now perceived to be both big and vital to geopolitics,” Vaishnav adds. Whether it’s hosting the G-20, being feted at the state dinner by President Biden, or even maintaining cordial relations with Vladimir Putin, he says that “many Indian diaspora members view this as a sign that India is back and experiencing a period of resurgence.”

The support for Modi comes despite the fact that while Indian Americans are hardly a monolith, they tend to vote for Democrats, rather than Republicans who more closely align with Modi’s right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party. As many as 74% of Indian American voters are thought to have backed Biden in 2020, according to a 2022 survey by AAPI Data, compared to just 15% supporting Donald Trump.

While Biden’s welcoming of Modi is widely seen in the context of Washington hoping to strike defense deals with New Delhi (most analysts tell TIME the reason for the visit can be distilled to one word—China—owing to the indispensable role of India in U.S. efforts to deter Chinese aggression), it’s also recognizing Modi’s popularity among a key American voting bloc. “In a time when the country has elections decided by four states and a margin of a few percent or less, every community really matters,” says Neil Makhija, the president of Indian American Impact advocacy group. “Ours really showed up in a significant way for [Biden] in Georgia, in Pennsylvania, in Arizona.”

Still, the Republican Party sees Indian Americans as a “natural constituency,” Vaishnav says. “They are well-off, and they’re business oriented. They care about low taxes, low regulation, and entrepreneurship, and they’re socially conservative. So I don’t think it’s a group that the Democratic Party is going to take for granted.”

A “very awkward” dilemma

Modi’s state visit also poses a strategic challenge to Biden. As a candidate, the U.S. President made defending human rights and democracy a cornerstone of his foreign policy agenda. Critics argue that his embrace of Modi, who over his two terms as Prime Minister has overseen significant democratic backsliding in India, is doing just the opposite.

The controversial Indian leader—who is poised to win his third term next year—has been accused of aggressively championing a Hindu-nationalist agenda that critics say reinvents the very idea of India as a pluralist, secular democracy to a religious, nationalist autocracy. Under Modi’s leadership, India has passed discriminatory laws that have alienated nearly 200 million Muslims; squashed dissent by jailing journalists, activists, and civil society organizations; and exercised judicial influence against his political opponents (notably, Rahul Gandhi, the de facto leader and scion of the Gandhi-Nehru family at the helm of the opposition Congress Party).

The U.S. has taken note. The State Department’s annual Religious Freedom Report, a survey of religious freedoms around the world, has expressed a number of concerns over India in recent years. It was notable that unlike last year, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made no mention of India in his speech this year, which analysts saw as a move to keep U.S.-India relations friendly ahead of Modi’s visit.

But according to Audrey Truschke, an associate professor of South Asian history at Rutgers University and a vocal critic of Modi’s Hindu nationalist base, the decision to host Modi shows that the “Biden administration does not care about human rights in India. If they did, there is absolutely no way that they would be hosting Modi right now.”

“It’s very awkward for the administration,” adds Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center think-tank in Washington, D.C. “The strategic imperatives of partnership limit the options for the administration to bring attention to this issue—especially publicly, given that this Indian government does not take kindly to any type of external criticism of its internal policies.” The top priority for the administration, he says, will be to “avoid any drama.”

While the White House may want to keep the visit as anodyne as possible, the same doesn’t appear to be the case for the Indian American community at large. In the run up to Modi’s visit, pro-Modi groups have organized “Unity” marches in nearly 20 American cities on June 18, while those opposed to Modi’s presence plan to stage a rally near the White House to coincide with his arrival on June 22.

In an open letter drafted by Hindus for Human Rights, a Washington D.C.-based advocacy group, several Indian Americans, human rights advocates, and concerned allies have also urged Biden to “push back” against the Indian government’s “escalating attacks on human rights and democracy.”

By honoring Modi, Truschke warns that the White House could inadvertently encourage communal violence within the Indian American community. “This will make Hindu nationalist groups feel even more emboldened in the U.S.,” says Truschke, who herself has been on the receiving end of threats from far-right Hindu nationalists.

Modi will become just the third world leader, after France’s Emmanuel Macron and South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol, to receive this kind of diplomatic reception from President Biden.

While Modi has visited the U.S. many times—most recently for a three-day visit in September 2021, where he held a bilateral meeting with Biden—this will be the first time the Prime Minister’s trip will be categorized as the highest ranked visit according to diplomatic protocol. (The last state visit to the U.S. by an Indian leader was by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in November 2009.)

As India takes center stage as the world’s most populous country, one of the fastest growing economies, and a powerhouse for tech and innovation, the Biden Administration hopes it can court the country as a crucial ally to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

“The visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space,” the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.

Below, what to know about the upcoming visit.

What are the top priorities for Modi’s state visit?

The state visit will include conversations aimed at further cementing an already-growing defense and manufacturing relationship between the U.S. and India. More recently, Washington and New Delhi have been engaged in discussions about jointly producing jet engines, long-range artillery, and military vehicles. In May, India joined Biden’s 14-member Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which primarily aims to reduce China’s economic dominance through manufacturing, but without drawing up a formal trade agreement. Now, American company General Electric is hoping to co-produce military jets in the country, while the U.S. has increased investment in a semiconductor and chip manufacturing ecosystem set in India as a way to decrease dependence on Chinese manufacturing.

“The United States has really oriented a lot of its domestic and foreign policy around this question of, ‘how do we counter the Chinese challenge?’” says Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at Carnegie. “So if you think about semiconductors and chip manufacturing, India is a big player right now.”

In the weeks leading up to Modi’s visit, both the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have also made trips to New Delhi in an attempt to cut through the red tape to secure deals.

This week, Reuters reported that India was inching closer to buying more than two dozen U.S.-made armed drones worth $2 to $3 billion to help enhance border surveillance and improve counterterrorism intelligence operations. The development comes after Sullivan, along with India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, unveiled an ambitious roadmap for Indo-U.S. collaboration in specific high-technology areas, including semiconductors, next-generation telecommunication, artificial intelligence and defense.

For India, striking deals with the U.S. will in turn strengthen the country’s hard power capabilities and make it a hotbed for innovation. “They are hoping to get more U.S. dollars, more U.S. companies, and more U.S. entrepreneurs to make India a central part of their growth and expansion plans,” says Vaishnav.

Why do the U.S. and India want to counter China?

Experts say both countries see their strategic interests converge in countering China’s threat as it becomes more expansionist and ambitious on the global stage. For the U.S., China has increasingly become its biggest competitor in the spheres of influence, while India has been embroiled in territorial disputes in the Himalayas ever since it fought a brief war with China in 1962.

In 2020, tensions between India and China flared when Beijing became more assertive over land claims along the shared Himalayan border and an altercation between Indian and Chinese military forces in the northern Indian region of Ladakh reportedly left 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead. China’s close ties to Pakistan has also resulted in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as part of the Belt and Road Initiative and controversially passes through a section of Kashmir controlled by Islamabad, adding to India’s concerns.

By helping India build up its economic and defense capabilities, Washington hopes to coordinate with New Delhi to tackle global challenges as part of its long-term interests, says Vaishnav. “Washington is really looking to create a framework of deterrence to essentially deter Chinese expansionism, and they view India as a linchpin in this strategy,” he says.

How has the relationship between India and the U.S. changed?

Relations between India and the U.S. have changed in notable ways over the years. After independence from British rule in 1947, India was more closely aligned with Russia during the Cold War era due to U.S. distrust and estrangement over India’s nuclear program, while the U.S. had a stronger partnership with India’s rival, Pakistan.

The two countries remained “estranged democracies,” according to the former U.S. Ambassador, Dennis Kux, until the early 1990s. However, since the early 2000s, U.S. administrations from Bill Clinton to Donald Trump have worked to build a strong relationship with India, recognizing its potential to be a strategic partner in ensuring the security of the Indo-Pacific region.

In 2005, India and the U.S. signed a major nuclear deal under which India was recognized de facto as a nuclear weapons power. More recently, India’s participation in the Quad, a security alliance between the U.S. and its allies, Australia, Japan and India, has led to the country becoming a critical element of American defense strategy.

Last year, the two countries conducted joint military exercises not far from the disputed Indo-China border, and in May, joined Biden’s 14-member Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which officials and business executives hope will reduce American reliance on Chinese manufacturing for mutual benefit, including increased iPhone shipments from Indian-based factories.

In a joint news conference with Modi, Biden called the relationship between the U.S. and India among the most consequential in the world and “more dynamic than at any time in history.” He underscored how two of the world’s most powerful democracies were cooperating on issues such as the climate, health care and space, saying that the U.S-India economic relationship was “booming.”

But Modi bristled at a reporter’s question about his country’s commitment to democratic values as the country has seen an erosion of religious, political and press freedoms under his watch.

“Democracy is our spirit,” Modi, who rarely takes questions from journalists, said through an interpreter. “Democracy runs in our veins. We live democracy and our ancestors have actually put words to this concept.” He said India has “proved that democracies can deliver and when I say deliver, this is regardless of class, creed, religion, gender.”

Yet Modi has faced criticism over legislation amending the country’s citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalization for some migrants but excludes Muslims, a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists, and the recent conviction of India’s top opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modi’s surname.

Nevertheless, later in a 59-minute address before a joint meeting of Congress, Modi insisted that in India “diversity is a natural way of life.”

“We are home to all faiths in the world, and we celebrate all of them,” added Modi, in a line that brought many cheering lawmakers to their feet.

The premier’s description runs counter to accusations by rights groups of widespread attacks and discrimination against India’s Muslims and other minorities under Modi.

A group of more than 70 lawmakers wrote to Biden this week urging him to raise concerns about the erosion of religious, press and political freedoms during the visit. At least six Democratic lawmakers —Democratic Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Greg Casar of Texas, Jamaal Bowman and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — boycotted Modi’s address to Congress, because of concerns about his human rights records.

“When it comes to standing up for human rights, actions speak louder than words,” Bush, Tlaib, Omar and Bowman said in a joint statement. “By bestowing Prime Minister Modi with the rare honor of a joint address, Congress undermines its ability to be a credible advocate for the rights of religious minorities and journalists around the world.”

Standing alongside Modi, Biden emphasized that press, religious and other fundamental freedoms should be at the core of how both democracies operate. During their Oval Office meeting, Biden said, he and Modi had a “good discussion about democratic values” while Modi said “there’s absolutely no space for discrimination” when pressed about his own commitment on human rights.

The state visit, just the third of the Biden’s presidency, was certainly a glitzy affair.

Thousands gathered on the White House South Lawn for the welcoming ceremony, listening to performances by violinist Vibha Janakiraman and the a cappella group Penn Masala. As Modi arrived, the crowd — including many members of the Indian diaspora — broke out in a chant of “Modi, Modi, Modi.”

“All eyes are on the two largest democracies in the world, India and America,” Modi said. “I believe that our strategic partnership is important. I’m confident that working together will be successful.”

Later, Modi told Congress that “our partnership augurs well for the future of democracy” as the two countries expand partnerships in defense, semiconductor manufacturing and other industries. He also cheered the “samosa caucus”—the five U.S. House members of Indian descent—and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is Black and of Indian descent, as examples of the impact of the diaspora.

Biden administration officials say honoring Modi, the leader of the conservative Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is Diplomacy 101. The U.S.-India relationship will be vital in coming decades as both sides navigate an ascendant China and the enormity of climate change, artificial intelligence, supply chain resilience and other issues.

“On the issues that matter most that will define the future, our nations look to one another including on critical regional and global issues,” Biden said.

Among the announcements made Thursday is an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.

The Biden administration also announced plans to bolster India’s semiconductor industry. U.S.-based Micron Technology has agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending more than $800 million and India financing the rest. U.S.-based Applied Materials will launch a new semiconductor center for commercialization and innovation in India, and Lam Research, another semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will start a training program for 60,000 Indian engineers.

On the space front, India signed on to the Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space exploration cooperation among nations participating in NASA’s lunar exploration plans. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station next year.

“We made critical and emerging technologies the pillar of our next generation partnership to ensure these technologies promote and protect our values, remain open, accessible, trusted and secure,” Biden added. “All this matters for America, for India and for the world.”

At the welcoming ceremony, Modi called the Indian diaspora in America — the millions of immigrants and their children from the subcontinent living in the U.S. — “the real strength” of the U.S.-India relationship. He said the honor of a formal state visit — the first in the U.S. for India since Barack Obama honored Modi’s predecessor, Manmohan Singh, in 2009 — reflected the positive impact Indians are having worldwide.

Modi, the son of a tea seller who rose to be India’s premier, also recalled that the first time he visited the White House was three decades ago as a “common man.”

“I have come here many times but today for the first time, the doors of the White House have been opened for the Indian American community in such large numbers,” Modi said to an estimated crowd of 7,000.

Despite the major deals, the visit was shadowed by concerns laid out by rights activists and lawmakers who question Modi’s commitment to democratic principles.

In 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi’s visa to the U.S., citing concerns that, as chief minister of the state of Gujarat, he did not act to stop communal violence during 2002 anti-Muslim riots that left more than 1,000 people dead. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.

Biden and Modi have also had differences over Russia’s war in Ukraine. India abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and refused to join the global coalition against Russia. Since the start of the war, the Modi government has also dramatically increased its purchase of Russian oil.

White House officials note that there are signs of change in India’s relationship with Russia, which has long been New Delhi’s biggest defense supplier.

India is moving away from Russian military equipment, looking more to the U.S., Israel, Britain and other nations. Modi recently met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and has spoken out about his worries about the potential use of nuclear weapons by Russia.

Modi, before Congress, said the war is “causing great pain” in Ukraine and having residual effects on Europe and beyond.

“This is not an era of war, but it is one of dialogue and diplomacy” Modi said. “And we must all do what we can to stop the bloodshed and human suffering.”

Without specifically naming China, Modi also addressed heightened tensions in the region, saying “dark clouds of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo Pacific.”

Later Thursday, Modi attended a lavish White House state dinner in his honor.

Summary

Companies U.S. expanding India ties to balance China’s rise

Modi only third Indian leader invited for state visit

Fighter jet engines, drones, semiconductors deals expected

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to the United States this week for a visit billed as a turning point for bilateral relations, with deeper cooperation in defence industry and sharing high technology in sharp focus.

The visit is expected to give India access to critical American technologies Washington rarely shares with non-allies, strengthening a new bond that is underpinned by not just global politics but also business and economics.

Washington and New Delhi, whose relationship was marked by mutual suspicion during the Cold War, have been moving closer for over two decades now with successive U.S. presidents displaying bipartisan support for stronger ties with the emerging Asian economy and regional power.

President Joe Biden has built on that legacy and expanded cooperation as the United States sees India as a vital partner in its efforts to push back against China's expanding influence worldwide and strengthen security in the Indo-Pacific.

Washington also wants to wean India away from its traditional defence partner Russia. New Delhi continues to do business with Moscow and has increased its purchases of cheap Russian oil in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, much to the frustration of the West.

India too has overcome its ""hesitations of history"" - as Modi put it in a 2016 address to U.S. Congress - and looked West amid its own military tensions and fraying ties with China.

Though Modi has made several previous visits to the United States, this will be his first with the full diplomatic status of an official state visit, just the third of Biden's presidency and third by any Indian leader.

""It’s a milestone in our relationship...It is a very significant visit, very important visit,"" India’s Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra told reporters on Monday.

A key achievement expected to be showcased is in the area of defence cooperation, especially between military industries of the two countries, Kwatra said, as India seeks to produce more weapons and equipment at home for itself and also for export.

JET ENGINES, DRONES, SEMICONDUCTORS

Major announcements expected during Modi's visit are U.S. approval to General Electric (GE.N) to manufacture engines in India for its domestically produced fighter jets, India's purchase of 31 armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones made by General Atomics worth $3 billion, and removal of U.S. obstacles that prevent smoother trade in defence and high technology.

""People will be looking back on this visit by Prime Minister Modi as a real springboard for the U.S.-India relationship, as it relates to defence ... issues in particular,"" Ely Ratner, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Affairs, said at a June 8 event.

A stronger India that can defend its own interests and can contribute to regional security is good for the United States, he said, adding that there is an aspiration to see India as an exporter of security in the region.

Cooperation in semiconductors, cyberspace, aerospace, strategic infrastructure and communication, commercial space projects, quantum computing and the use of artificial intelligence in industrial and defence fields, will also be discussed, a senior Indian official said.

During the three-day visit that begins in New York on June 21, Modi will be hosted by President Biden for a state dinner and a private family dinner, attend lunch with Vice-President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and address a joint session of Congress for the second time in nine years.

Modi will also meet American CEOs and lead an International Yoga Day event at the UN headquarters.

""This is not a routine visit, this is a fundamental turning point between India and the U.S.,"" C. Raja Mohan, Senior Fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New Delhi.

""This is not a question of containing China or anti-China. This is about producing a new balance of power in Asia, which is a multipolar Asia, where there is no single power dominating it,"" he said.

Propelling Global Growth



37. As two of the world’s largest democratic economies, the United States and India are indispensable partners in advancing global prosperity and a free, fair, and rules-based economic order. President Biden highlighted the impactful participation of Prime Minister Modi in the G7 Hiroshima Summit and looks forward to the G20 Summit in September in New Delhi. He applauded India’s leadership in its ongoing G20 Presidency, which has brought renewed focus on strengthening multilateral institutions and international cooperation to tackle global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, fragility and conflict, along with work to accelerate achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and lay the foundation for strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.



38. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi are united in their determination to use the G20 to deliver on shared priorities for the G20 Leaders’ Summit, including improving the sovereign debt restructuring process; advancing the multilateral development bank evolution agenda, including mobilizing new concessional financing at the World Bank to support all developing countries; and raising the level of ambition on mobilizing private sector investment for quality, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure, including through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. The United States looks forward to hosting the G20 presidency in 2026, nearly two decades after the first full-scale G20 Leaders’ Summit in Pittsburgh.



39. The United States and India recognize the potential of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) approaches for enabling open and inclusive digital economies. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi intend to work together to provide global leadership for the implementation of DPI to promote inclusive development, competitive markets, and protect individual rights. In this regard, the United States and India will explore how to partner together and align our efforts to advance the development and deployment of robust DPIs, including appropriate safeguards to protect, privacy, data security and intellectual property. They will explore developing a U.S.-India Global Digital Development Partnership, which would bring together technology and resources from both countries to enable development and deployment of DPIs in developing countries.



40. The leaders are committed to pursuing ambitious efforts to strengthen Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to address shared global challenges of the 21st century. In this regard, they emphasized the need for comprehensive efforts by MDBs to evolve their vision, incentive structure, operational approaches and financial capacity so that they are better equipped to address a wide range of SDGs and trans-boundary challenges including climate change, pandemics, conflicts and fragility. Recognizing multilateral efforts in this area, the leaders acknowledged the ongoing work under the Indian presidency of the G20 on strengthening MDBs including the report of the G20 Expert Group on Strengthening MDBs. By the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi, the United States and India will work together to secure G20 commitment to create a major new dedicated pool of funds at the World Bank to deploy concessional lending for global challenges, and to enhance support for crisis response in International Development Association recipient countries.



41. The leaders reaffirmed that the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) is an important pillar of our collective and collaborative efforts to build resilience in our supply chains, harness transformations in clean energy, and accelerate progress of our economies through anti-corruption efforts, efficient tax administrative practices, and capacity building measures. The leaders welcomed the substantial conclusion of negotiations on the proposed IPEF Supply Chain Agreement and committed to working with other partners expeditiously to conclude negotiations of the agreements under the clean economy and fair economy pillars to deliver concrete benefits that enhance the economic competitiveness and prosperity of countries in the Indo-Pacific. President Biden invited India to attend the APEC Summit in San Francisco in November 2023 as a guest of the host.



42. The U.S.-India trade and investment partnership is an engine for global growth, with bilateral trade exceeding $191 billion in 2022, nearly doubling from 2014. The leaders applauded the reconvening of the U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue and CEO Forum in March in New Delhi. They encouraged respective industries to take action on the recommendations from the CEOs for greater engagement and technical cooperation to build resilient supply chains for emerging technologies, clean energy technologies, and pharmaceuticals; promote an innovative digital economy; lower barriers to trade and investment; harmonize standards and regulations wherever feasible; and work towards skilling our workforces. The leaders support continued active engagement between the U.S. Treasury Department and the Indian Ministry of Finance under the Economic and Financial Partnership dialogue. They encouraged the U.S. Federal Insurance Office and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India to advance areas of mutual interest in the insurance sector under their existing MoU framework.



43. The United States and India have also taken steps toward deepening bilateral cooperation to strengthen our economic relationship, including trade ties. Underscoring the willingness and trust of both countries in resolving trade issues, the leaders welcomed the resolution of six outstanding WTO disputes between the two countries through mutually agreed solutions as well as their understandings on market access related to certain products of significance to the bilateral trade relationship. They also looked forward to reconvening the India-U.S. Trade Policy Forum before the end of 2023 to further enhance the bilateral trade relationship by addressing trade concerns and identifying further areas for engagement. India highlighted its interest in the restoration of its status under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences program, which could be considered in relation to eligibility criteria determined by the U.S. Congress. The leaders supported intensifying the work to advance progress on issues related to the eligibility criteria. Prime Minister Modi also expressed India’s interest towards being recognized as a Trade Agreements Act-designated country by the United States to further enhance the integration of both economies and to further promote trade and investment between two countries. In this regard, the leaders welcomed the initiation of discussions between both sides at an official level on issues related to bilateral government procurement.



44. The leaders welcomed focused efforts under the re-launched U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue to expand cooperation in the areas of Talent, Innovation, and Inclusive Growth. President Biden expressed appreciation for the significant workforce development efforts undertaken by several of the Indian companies taking part in the U.S.-India CEO Forum to upskill more than 250,000 employees and promote STEM learning within local communities across the United States. Both leaders applauded the concept of an “Innovation Handshake” under the Commercial Dialogue that will lift up and connect the two sides’ dynamic startup ecosystems, address specific regulatory hurdles to cooperation, and promote further innovation and job growth, particularly in emerging technologies. The Innovation Handshake demonstrates the resolve on both sides to further bolster their shared vision of an elevated strategic technology partnership, leveraging the strength and ingenuity of their respective private sectors to identify new innovations and match them with industry requirements across the priority sectors identified under the iCET framework.



45. Recognizing the essential role that micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) play in advancing inclusive growth, expanding exports, and boosting employment across our respective cities, towns, and rural areas, the leaders welcomed plans under the Commercial Dialogue to organize a forum to promote the role and scope of MSMEs in bilateral trade and a digital commerce showcase to strengthen the engagement of women-owned and rural enterprises in particular. They commended the work of the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Indian Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, which are pursuing increased cooperation and intend to formalize their work through a MoU to support entrepreneurs and MSMEs.



46. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi again welcomed Air India’s historic agreement with Boeing to acquire more than 200 American-made aircraft. This purchase will support more than one million American jobs across 44 states and contribute to ongoing efforts to modernize the civil aviation sector in India. Boeing has announced a $100 million investment on infrastructure and programs to train pilots in India, supporting India’s need for 31,000 new pilots over the next 20 years. The leaders also welcomed Boeing’s announcement of its completion of a C-17 aftermarket support facility for MRO and a new parts logistics center in India to capture future synergies between defense and civil aviation.



Empowering Future Generations and Protecting the Health of our People



47. President Biden and Prime Minister hailed the growing bilateral education partnership between the United States and India. Indian students are on pace to soon become the largest foreign student community in the United States, with an increase of nearly 20 percent in Indian students studying in the United States last year alone. The leaders welcomed the establishment of a new Joint Task Force of the Association of American Universities and leading Indian educational institutions, including the Indian Institutes of Technology, and the nomination of councils on each side, and noted their interim recommendations for expanding research and university partnerships between the two countries. They also welcomed the establishment of Indo-U.S. Global Challenge Institutes to spark deeper research partnerships and people-to-people exchanges between a range of diverse institutions in the U.S. and India in semiconductors, sustainable agriculture, clean energy, health and pandemic preparedness, and emerging technologies.



48. The leaders welcomed an announcement by the U.S. Department of State that it would launch a pilot to adjudicate domestic renewals of certain petition-based temporary work visas later this year, including for Indian nationals, with the intent to implement this for an expanded pool of H1B and L visa holders in 2024 and eventually broadening the program to include other eligible categories.



49. The leaders affirmed that the movement of professional and skilled workers, students, investors and business travelers between the countries contributes immensely to enhancing bilateral economic and technological partnership. While acknowledging the important steps taken to augment processing of visa applications, they noted the pressing need to further expedite this process. The leaders also directed officials to identify additional mechanisms to facilitate travel for business, tourism, and professional and technical exchanges between the two countries.



50. Concomitant with the rapid growth in our strategic partnership and demand for travel, both sides intend to open new consulates in each other’s countries. The United States intends to initiate the process to open two new consulates in India in the cities of Bengaluru and Ahmedabad. India will take steps to operationalize its new consulate in Seattle later this year, and open two new consulates at jointly identified locations in the United States.



51. The leaders recognized the role of asocial security totalization agreement in protecting the interests of cross border workers and reaffirmed the intent to continue ongoing discussions concerning the elements required in both countries to enter into a bilateral social security totalization agreement.



52. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi celebrate the historic and active collaboration across the full expanse of our respective health sectors. They welcomed the opportunity for deeper collaboration to secure pharmaceutical supply chains. The leaders encouraged their administrations to continue their strong collaboration on pandemic preparedness, supported by epidemiology training; laboratory strengthening and point of entry surveillance; and food safety and regulation. The leaders applauded collaborations between research institutes of both countries on affordable cancer technology programs, including for the development of AI enabled diagnostic and prognosis prediction tools, and on diabetes research. The leaders committed to holding a U.S.-India Cancer Dialogue, hosted by President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot, to bring experts together from both countries to identify concrete areas of collaboration to accelerate the rate of progress against cancer. They also called for expanded collaboration on digital health platforms including responsible use of cutting-edge technologies like AI, and to explore cooperation in research and the use of traditional medicine. President Biden lauded Prime Minister Modi’s plan to eliminate tuberculosis in India by 2025, five years ahead of the target set by the UN’s sustainable development goals, hailing it as a big step forward that will inspire other countries to action.



53. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi welcomed the opportunity for deeper collaboration to secure, de-risk, and strengthen pharmaceutical supply chains, with a focus on active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials, and key vaccine input materials. They also underscored the need for strengthening global collaboration network on research and development in medical countermeasures, vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to promote access to safe, effective, and innovative medical products in an affordable manner.



54. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi committed to work toward a broader and deeper bilateral drug policy framework for the 21st century. Under this framework, both countries aspire to expand cooperation and collaboration to disrupt the illicit production and international trafficking of illicit drugs, including synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl and Amphetamine Type Stimulants and illicit use of their Precursors. Toward this end, they committed to a holistic public health partnership to prevent and treat illicit drug use, address workforce shortages and skilling requirements, and showcase a secure, resilient, reliable and growing pharmaceutical supply chain as a model for the world.



55. Prime Minister Modi conveyed his deep appreciation for the repatriation of antiquities to India by the United States. Both sides expressed strong interest in working quickly toward a Cultural Property Agreement, which would help to prevent illegal trafficking of cultural property from India and enhance cooperation on the protection and lawful exchange of cultural property.



56. The Leaders welcomed the establishment of the Tamil Studies Chair at the University of Houston and reinstating the Vivekananda Chair at the University of Chicago to further research and teaching of India’s history and culture.



57. Prime Minister Modi looked forward to the visit of President Biden to the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi in September 2023.



58. Taken together, the leaders today affirmed that this document, in its breadth and depth, represents the most expansive and comprehensive vision for progress in the history of our bilateral relationship. Still, our ambitions are to reach ever greater heights, and we commit both our governments and our peoples to this endeavor, now and into the future.

WASHINGTON: If the emerging itinerary and venues are anything to go by, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be embarking next week on a US trip like none before and none other in the annals of foreign visits as Washington pulls out all stops to draw New Delhi into its sphere of influence.India, in turn, is not going to be shy of showing off its cultural and economic equities in the US.Although a frequent visitor to America, averaging about one trip every year since he became Prime Minister in 2014, Modi's first ever state visit, centered around a ceremonial reception and banquet at the White House on June 22, will be bookended by other marquee events on June 21 and 23.Presiden Biden and First Lady Jill Biden are expected to host a intimate private dinner for the Prime Minister on June 21 ahead of the state banquet on June 22, which, according to the US President himself, is now the hottest ticket in America, with the rich, powerful, and famous badgering the White House for an invitation.""You’re causing me a real problem. Everyone in the whole country wants to come. I have run out of tickets.” Biden said only half-jokingly to Modi in the sidelines of the G7 summit in Hiroshima last month.White House officials acknowledge they are deluged with requests, as is the Indian Embassy, which is directing all inquiries to the White House since it is the host.The guest list, which will be announced only on the eve of the dinner, is being tightly controlled and vetted, particularly after a security breach in 2009 when a Virginia couple managed to gatecrash into President Obama's state dinner for then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.Modi will arrive in Washington after landing in New York where he will participate in the International Yoga Day at the United Nations, with New Delhi asserting its cultural proprietorship of the practice in recent years.A ceremonial reception with the all the bells and whistles befitting a state visit will be rolled out at the White House for the Indian Prime Minister, who surprisingly will be staying at a hotel next door rather than at Blair House, which is the standard venue for dignitaries during state visits.Sources said Blair House, a historic red brick building across from the White House, where Prime Minister Modi has stayed before during an official visit, has limitations that would circumscribe the large Indian delegation and its many engagements.Those who don't make the cut for the state dinner at the White House will have at least three other opportunities to engage with India's Prime Minister: A CEOs meeting at the rooftop off the Kennedy Center to be hosted by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), a luncheon meeting at the State Department hosted by Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and an Indian-American community reception in the Ronald Reagan building which is expected to be a rousing 5000-people finale before Modi flies out.Officials on both sides say it won't just be pomp, ceremony, and celebration during the visit; there will be plenty of business conducted, with substantial announcements in the defense and people-centric high tech areas.""The ceremonial and substantive part of the state visit will fully complement each other and will be unparalleled,"" India's ambassador to the US Taranjit Sandhu said.Sandhu himself has had the distinction of having served in the United States four times: first as a young political officer from 1997 to 2000, then at the Permanent Mission of India to United Nations from July 2005 to February 2009; as the Deputy Chief of Mission in Washington DC from July 2013 to January 2017, and finally a career topping finale as India's ambassador to the United States from February 2020 to date."

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet President Joe Biden on Thursday during his first state visit to the U.S. High on the agenda will be deepening of defense ties, partnerships in technology and India's role in the Indo-Pacific. Ties between India and the U.S. are at a turning point and the relationship between the two nations have improved in the last decade, said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at Observer Research Foundation, a Delhi-based think tank. ""This is a very important visit, it is as much about India reaching out to the U.S., as it is about the U.S. reaching out to India,"" Pant said. Biden has only hosted two state visits during his presidency, the first with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in December 2022, and the second with South Korea's president Yoon Suk Yeol in April. ""This visit symbolizes the unwavering commitment to deepening ties and signifies the immense potential for both countries to collaborate amidst global challenges,"" Farwa Aamer the director of South Asia initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said. ""For many in India and the U.S., the visit is a testament to the promise and high expectations for the future of U.S.-India collaboration — one of shared prosperity,"" Aamer said. The U.S. is looking at India as a partner it can rely on, but its partnership will be very different since India is not an ally, Pant told CNBC. ""The U.S. is not used to having partners that are not allies, but is willing to look at its partnership with India differently — one that is relatively independent minded but will help American priorities as well,"" he said in a phone interview.

Strengthening defense ties

India and Russia have long shared a steadfast relationship, with India relying heavily on the Kremlin for oil and military weapons. The South Asian nation is the world's largest buyer of Russian arms, accounting for approximately 20% of Russia's current order, Reuters reported. ""India has been too dependent on one country and that is not good, and although dependence has dropped from 80% in the 1990s to about 65% now, dependence is still huge,"" Pant pointed out. However, because of the war in Ukraine, Russia has not been able to send critical defense weapons it had promised India, pushing the Indian military to look to others — such as the U.S. — for supplies.

Still, analysts are optimistic that the meeting between Biden and Modi could lead to more weapons agreements. India has long been interested in buying SeaGuardian drones from the U.S., but the hoped-for deal that could be worth between $2 billion to $3 billion has been long hampered by ""bureaucratic stumbling blocks,"" Reuters reported. The deal could still be brought back to the table. ""India's Ministry of Defense has reportedly approved the purchase so it seems likely. The U.S. would like this to go through,"" Manjari Miller, senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations told CNBC. ""It would be important for the partnership — only a few military allies and NATO countries have this drone, and the U.S. is particular about whom it sells U.S. weapons and technology to."" She highlighted that now is an important time for the deal to come through as it will draw ""India closer into the U.S. defense orbit, and is a step away from India's dependence on Russian arms and equipment."" India is undermining its strategic options by thinking it can continue to rely on Russia, Lisa Curtis, senior fellow and director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. ""It wants to try to keep a wedge between Russia and China because it doesn't want to contemplate the idea of Russia and China both arrayed against it. Then you throw Pakistan in there and things look really dire from the Indian perspective,"" Curtis told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The drones will also enhance the Indian armed forces ""intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance capabilities"" that will aid the country in securing their borders with China and Pakistan, Karthik Nachiappan, research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore said. Tensions between India and China over the disputed border in the Himalayan region has been ongoing since the 1950s with no end in sight. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in June 2020 in hand-to-hand combat with Chinese troops, followed by another clash in December 2022. But India wants to ""go beyond a buyer-seller relationship,"" with the U.S., Pant said adding that India is working toward a ""co-production and co-development relationship"" with the U.S. so it can build its own domestic manufacturing defense base. Private sectors in the U.S. could also start making more significant investments in India, with the two countries set to work together on producing fighter jet engines, said Pant. ""There's a change in the way the U.S. looks at India, and defense will be a beneficiary of that. India will definitely be looking to reduce its dependence on Russia, and that will be quite an extreme move,"" he added. Without mentioning China, the White House said in May the visit will ""strengthen our two countries' shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space."" ""Both the United States and India share the objective of not having an Asia that is dominated by China, or an Indo-Pacific region that is subject to Chinese coercion and assertiveness,"" said Ashley Tellis, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in a Q&A report.

Energy: Reliance on Russian oil

Although India's purchase of Russian weapons could fall, the same can't be said for oil. When Western nations imposed sanctions on Russian oil as a result of the unprovoked war in Ukraine, India doubled down on its purchases. Russian oil currently accounts for almost 20% of India's annual crude imports, a significant increase from just 2% in 2021, Reuters reported. Oil prices were extremely volatile at the start of the Ukraine war in February last year, spiking to $100 for the first time since 2014 . But India has continued to buy cheap Russian oil since and continues trading with the country despite global sanctions on the Kremlin.

""India has become very close to the West in the last five to 10 years, but it understands that it cannot simply detach from Russia,"" Amit Ranjan, research fellow at the NUS Institute of South Asian Studies said. ""Russia is an old friend of India, and India understands the importance of the relationship … Oil is an important piece of that relationship,"" Ranjan said.

Technology: Diversifying from China

Partnerships in technology will be also be top on the agenda for Modi. ""I think the technology issues have become so critically important, as we see China making advancements and hear about China's advancements with AI,"" according to Curtis. ""In seeing how much China is advancing, the U.S. now understands the importance of really cooperating closely with India and trying to take advantage of the strengths on both sides,"" she said. ""There are so many ways that the two sides can benefit from this increased technology cooperation—not to mention the progress that has been made on semiconductors. This has been a real area of focus for India and the United States, and I see that only growing as we move into the future,"" Curtis added. There will also be a flurry of business meetings with tech leaders. Tesla chief Elon Musk met Modi in New York to discuss the EV company's ambitions in India and the possibility of setting up a manufacturing facilities in the country. Modi is also expected to meet other CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft's Satya Nadella and FedEx's Raj Subramaniam at the White House state dinner on Thursday, sources told CNBC. The growing partnership between India and the U.S. also gives room for the two nations to adopt a ""China plus one"" strategy and push more technology companies to set up operations in India, analysts told CNBC. The U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology was announced in May last year. The iCET initiative aims to ""elevate and expand"" the two countries' technology partnership and defense industrial cooperation, the White House said in January. Pant said it points to the two countries' willingness to work together — both in terms of research and development, and what both governments can do together. In the last six months, more U.S. technology companies have set their eyes on India."
117,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/21/whats-behind-indian-prime-minister-narendra-modis-us-visit,What’s behind Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s US visit?,2023-06-21 00:00:00,"The US is seeking stronger ties with India, which it sees as a vital ally in efforts to contain China’s rise.

The administration of United States President Joe Biden is scheduled to host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an official visit later this week, as the two countries strengthen their ties amid shared antipathy towards China’s growing influence.

The White House will hold a state dinner in Modi’s honour on June 22, a sign of the burgeoning relationship between the two powers who have stepped up cooperation in areas such as trade and arms sales.

In a press release, the Biden administration said that a recent trip to New Delhi by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan “underscored the dynamism of the US-India partnership in advance of Prime Minister Modi’s historic official state visit next week to the United States”.

But human rights groups say the celebratory dinner is a de facto endorsement of India’s far-right turn under Modi’s leadership — and undermines the Biden administration’s stated goal of emphasising human rights and democracy in its foreign policy.

During Modi’s tenure, India’s Muslims and other minorities have experienced an uptick in violence and repression as the government leans into a form of Hindu nationalism known as Hindutva. Modi has also been criticised for seeking to consolidate power and crack down on dissent.

“A state dinner is a special occasion; it’s not something that just any foreign leader receives,” Edward Mitchell, the deputy executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told Al Jazeera over a phone call.

“How can the White House honour a leader who is an open anti-Muslim bigot, a right-wing ideologue who censors journalists and turns a blind eye to lynchings? You can work with India and Modi without taking this extra step to celebrate him.”





Confronting China

While advocacy groups have called for greater scrutiny of India’s human rights record, foreign policy experts say the Biden administration is primarily interested in the country as a potential counterweight to China, which the US sees as its most formidable global competitor.

Sarang Shidore, Director of Studies and Senior Research Fellow at the Quincy Institute, a US-based think tank, told Al Jazeera that he believes the US-India relationship will continue to grow as long as their shared concern over China remains in place.

“The United States does not conduct its foreign policy based on democracy and human rights. It conducts its foreign policy based on its interests, as all states do,” Shidore said.

China’s growing military power and assertive territorial claims have become a source of concern for nearby Asian countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Japan and India. The US has worked to fashion alliances with many of those countries in an attempt to contain China’s expanding influence.

“No question, there is increased Chinese nationalism,” said Shidore. “And China sees India as an increasing challenge due to its relationship with the US.”





Expanding ties

That was not always the case. During the Cold War, India’s relations with the US were often frosty. The country had cultivated close ties with the USSR and helped spearhead the Non-Aligned Movement, an organisation of countries that rejected pressures to join either pro-US or pro-Soviet blocs.

For its part, the US was a key ally of Pakistan. And by the early 1970s, the administration of US President Richard Nixon started to build a cooperative relationship with China, as an attempt, in part, to place pressure on the USSR.

But as the Cold War ended and China’s economic rise became a preoccupation of US foreign policy, India — with its size and economic heft — started to be seen as a key regional ally.

Despite its improved ties with the US, however, India has continued to resist what it sees as a false choice between the US and countries like President Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

But as Russia wages war in Ukraine and Washington seeks to isolate Moscow economically and diplomatically, that balancing act has become more difficult for India to maintain.

While India has increased its purchase of weapons from countries such as France and the US and recently agreed on a roadmap to increase cooperation with the US defence industry, it remains the world’s largest importer of Russian arms.

India has also joined China in buying up Russian oil at discounted prices, while the US and the European Union angle to limit Russia’s power in the global energy market.

But Shidore said that India’s status as a central player in Washington’s Asia strategy gives it significant leverage. Its ties to Russia are not likely to get in the way of its relationship with the US, he explained.

“India has played this quite well, playing Russia and the US off each other, and has benefitted in the process,” he said. “A country like India, which has such a strong convergence with the US on China, can create major spaces where it will differ very strongly from the US and can ride that out.”





Consolidating control

While US relations with allies such as Saudi Arabia and Israel have come under political scrutiny in recent years, Modi’s trip to the US has been welcomed with bipartisan support. An a joint letter inviting Modi to address Congress during his visit, members of the US House of Representatives and Senate have hailed the visit as a sign of the “enduring friendship” between the two countries.

“During your address, you will have the opportunity to share your vision for India’s future and speak to the global challenges our countries both face,” the letter reads.

However, Modi’s human rights record has not gone entirely unremarked. On Tuesday, a group of more than 70 lawmakers from the US House and Senate penned a letter to the Biden urging him to discuss concerns about religious freedom and journalistic expression in his talks with Modi.

The Muslim rights group CAIR, meanwhile, has issued a statement calling on the White House to drop its plans for a state dinner.

Modi’s high-profile reception in the US is a far cry from what he experienced before he was first elected prime minister in 2014. Prior to becoming India’s leader, Modi had been banned from entering the US due to allegations that he turned a blind eye to anti-Muslim violence in the western Indian state of Gujarat in 2002, when he was the province’s chief minister.

The deadly 2002 riots were the subject of a BBC documentary that Modi tried to ban in January, invoking his emergency powers as prime minister. The rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch screened the documentary in Washington on Tuesday.

Human rights groups say the move to ban the film was representative of a larger effort under Modi to stifle dissent and exercise control over independent institutions. They also accuse his government of pursuing an agenda influenced by far-right Hindu nationalism.

In an annual report on religious freedom in May, the US State Department expressed concern about the situation in India, noting that there were “open calls for genocide against Muslims”, lynchings and “attacks on places of worship”.

In May, for the fourth year in a row, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom called on the State Department to designate India as a “country of particular concern”.

In some states controlled by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), politicians who lean into violent anti-Muslim rhetoric face little reprimand. Some Hindu nationalist paramilitaries have also waged a campaign against interfaith marriages, which they portray as an effort to dilute the Hindu population and win converts to Islam through “love jihad”.

Shidore, however, said that Modi’s human rights record has been quickly “papered over” and is unlikely to prevent cooperation with the US, so long as China remains a serious global competitor.

“The United States”, he said, “has set human rights issues aside in order to strengthen ties”."

120,https://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/implications-of-modis-state-visit-to-us,Implications of Modi’s State Visit to U.S.,2023-06-29 11:30:27+08:00,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States from June 21 to 24 drew widespread attention from the international community. It was Modi’s sixth visit and first official state visit. To highlight its importance to U.S.-India relations, the United States made unprecedented arrangements for receiving the Indian leader. Modi was invited to address a joint session of Congress, a privilege previously only bestowed on a select few political figures, such as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill during World War II and Nelson Mandela of South Africa.

U.S. President Joe Biden hosted a state banquet for Modi, praising the significance of U.S.-India relations, commending Modi’s contributions and expressing optimism about future developments. Modi was thrilled to affirm the U.S.-India relationship using the popular abbreviation AI, which has become popular worldwide.

Before the trip to Washington, both India and the U.S. had touted it as highly significant. The Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that the visit would concentrate on strengthening the strategic partnership between India and the U.S., with a focus on developing a comprehensive and forward-thinking global strategic partnership. The White House echoed this sentiment, asserting that Modi’s visit would reinforce the already deep relationship between America and India, strengthen friendship between the two nations and create a “partnership between our two great countries, which spans the seas to the stars.”

During Modi’s discussions with President Biden, the two leaders explored various essential topics for establishing a strategic partnership, including creating a technology cooperation partnership for the future that involves space and ocean cooperation, technology transfers, export controls, new tech development and artificial intelligence. Additionally, both sides agreed to further promote defense partnerships and related industry cooperation, such as the United States transferring fighter jet engines and selling large armed sea drones to India. They also discussed critical mineral supplies, advanced infrastructure cooperation, clean energy, and regional and global security.

Modi’s visit to the United States achieved multiple breakthroughs in U.S.-India relations, including the signing of several cooperation agreements in trade, investment, energy, climate, defense and technology. Of those agreements, the most significant may have been the United States allowing General Electric to produce jet fighter engines in India. This fulfills India’s longstanding demand for advanced domestically produced fighter jets, which are crucial for enhancing India’s defense production capacity by reducing dependence on imported aircraft.

Additionally, 31 MQ-9B Maritime Guardian armed drones will be sold to India by the United States. This is worth highlighting, as these drones will significantly bolster the combat capabilities of the Indian military and have a multiplier effect in potential conflicts with adversaries. It’s also important to note that India and the United States reached an agreement on the sharing of defense information and exchanging military liaison officers. This is an area of great sensitivity, and its impact on neighboring countries cannot be overstated.

The significant breakthrough in diplomatic relations between India and the United States was influenced by various geopolitical and geo-economic factors. The United States aims to maintain its preeminent position in the Asia-Pacific and Indo-Pacific regions, contain and encircle other nations that may resist its hegemony and reinforce an exclusionary geopolitical group — the Quad — to form a unified force allowing it to pursue its own strategic interests. The United States has made significant efforts and invested considerable resources into India, offering preferential treatment that even some of its long-term allies have not received.

Meanwhile, India is undergoing rapid development, and it aspires to become a major global power in the near future. Therefore, it is keen to cultivate relations with the world’s only remaining superpower, the United States, in order to gain geopolitical advantage, attract money and technology, and acquire advanced weaponry. To that end, it’s not surprising that India, the most populous nation in the world, is drawing closer to the sole superpower, the United States.

U.S.-India relations will continue to deepen, based on the current trend of development. However, their relationship requires further exploration. This is because India and the United States have different national strategies. Although their interests and pursuits coincide significantly, there are still significant differences between them.

For instance, on global governance, the United States seeks absolute power under its unipolar dominance, while India pursues multipolarization and maintains cordial relations with multiple entities on the international stage. The United States does not like to see this happening. Similarly, in national governance, the United States contests and criticizes many issues in India, which India deems unacceptable.

Likewise, there are significant differences in economic, trade and investment interests between India and the United States. In terms of the India-U.S. relationship itself, the United States pursues a strategic relationship, while India, at most, wants to be strategically related but will never abandon its fundamental diplomatic philosophy of strategic autonomy.

Many of India’s positions on important international issues do not align with what the United States would prefer. Additionally, India will not forego any opportunities or options to strengthen diplomacy and improve relations with other countries that play significant roles in geopolitics. This is all part of a comprehensive effort to safeguard India’s historical opportunities for development."
121,https://www.financialexpress.com/business/defence-big-takeaways-from-pm-modis-state-visit-to-the-us-3139868/,Big takeaways from PM Modi’s State visit to the US,,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to the United States has resulted in significant outcomes, particularly in the realm of technology cooperation. – The visit has been hailed as path-breaking, with various deals and agreements being forged between the two nations.

Advancements in defense partnership, space cooperation, and commitment of both nations to harnessing advanced technologies for mutual benefit. The joint production of jet engines, the procurement of HALE drones, and the establishment of semiconductor facilities demonstrate a substantial leap in indigenous manufacturing capabilities and defense partnerships.

The collaboration in quantum computing and space exploration opens new frontiers for scientific advancement and global cooperation. As both nations continue to deepen their ties, the state visit serves as a testament to the shared vision of progress, innovation, and strategic partnership between India and the US.

Technology Cooperation: Advancing Across Domains

Technology cooperation featured prominently in discussions, covering diverse domains such as defense, space, and energy. The focus was on advanced technology, with an emphasis on technology transfer, services, and collaborative research. This comprehensive approach to technology cooperation marks a significant achievement of the state visit.



Key Projects and Agreements: Jet Engines and Drones

General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) signed an MoU to jointly produce fighter jet engines, enabling greater technology transfer and indigenous manufacturing capabilities.

The Indian Navy, Army, and Air Force will procure 31 MQ-9B High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) drones from the US, strengthening India’s surveillance and attack capabilities. These drones are going to be assembled in India and will be deployed to enhance the ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities of Indian Navy, Air Force and Army.

To support long term goals in boosting India’s indigenous defence capabilities, the US based General Atomics will set up a Comprehensive Global MRO facility in the country.

Semiconductor Manufacturing and 5G/6G Technologies:

Micron Technology will invest up to USD 825 million to build a new semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, supported by the Indian government.

Joint Task Forces on advanced telecommunications, focused on Open RAN and 5G/6G research and development, were launched by Prime Minister Modi and President Biden. India’s Bharat 6G Alliance and the US Next G Alliance will be led by Public-private cooperation in these areas.

Quantum Computing:

India and the US have established a joint Indo-US Quantum Coordination Mechanism to facilitate collaboration among industry, academia, and government. The aim is to develop a comprehensive Quantum Information Science and Technology agreement, furthering advancements in quantum computing.



Advancements in Defence Partnership:

The defence sector witnessed significant developments during PM Modi’s visit.

The joint production of fighter jet engines with General Electric and HAL marks the beginning of a new era in the India-US partnership, enabling indigenous manufacturing capabilities. The joint statement referred to this deal as a “landmark” and “trailblazing initiative” for greater technology transfer.

Exploring New Frontiers in Space Cooperation:

NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will work together to develop a strategic framework for human spaceflight cooperation by the end of 2023. India signed the Artemis Accords, which advance a common vision of space exploration for the benefit of humankind.

The Artemis Accords aim to land the first woman and person of color on the Moon, conduct scientific discoveries, and explore more of the lunar surface.

Concern for Ukraine and Commitment to Global Security:

Both leaders expressed deep concern over the conflict in Ukraine, acknowledging its tragic humanitarian consequences. The impacts of the war on the global economic system, including food, fuel, and energy security, were underscored, calling for greater efforts to mitigate them.

Commitment to providing humanitarian assistance to Ukraine was reiterated, along with a renewed commitment to empowering the Quad as a partnership for global good."
122,https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/06/modis-trip-washington-marks-new-heights-us-india-ties,Modi’s Trip to Washington Marks New Heights in U.S.-India Ties,,"Against the backdrop of tightening U.S.-India ties, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to Washington this week for an official state visit — only the third President Joe Biden has hosted since taking office. The bilateral relationship has soared to new heights in recent years, particularly on economic, technological and defense issues. Underpinning these developments is both sides’ desire to counter China’s effort to project power and influence across the Indo-Pacific region. While Washington and New Delhi have their disagreements on issues like Russia’s war on Ukraine and human rights, they see the relationship as too strategically vital to be jeopardized by these differences.

USIP’s Tamanna Salikuddin, Vikram Singh, Sameer Lalwani and Daniel Markey analyze the significance of this visit, the difficult issues that will be on the table, and how China will factor will into the leaders’ discussions.

What is the significance of the state visit for both the United States and for India?

Salikuddin: Modi’s visit will be filled with substantive and ceremonial events, including a South Lawn welcome, a state dinner and an address to a joint session of Congress. While Modi has visited the United States several times, this will be his first state visit, demonstrating the depth of the bilateral U.S.-India relationship, which Biden has described as the “defining relationship” of the 21st century. Per the White House’s official announcement, “the visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space.”

While none of the official statements mention China, this visit is all about China. As U.S.-China competition is only becoming more intense and the Biden administration identifies China as its “pacing” challenge, India is one of the most important partners for the United States in its Indo-Pacific policy. While India actively counters China on its northern border, its deepening relationship with the United States make it part of the bulwark of nations committed to countering Beijing’s malign influence.

Beyond the convergence on China, India and the United States are seeking deeper ties on economic, defense and technological grounds. This visit is significant in cementing the partnership, and no detail is being left unchecked with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan visiting New Delhi in the last few weeks. This visit and the broader high-level U.S.-India engagements this year — including Biden’s planned trip to New Delhi in the fall — are a high-water mark in the bilateral relationship. Coming 18 years after the historic U.S.-India civil nuclear deal, these engagements highlight the remarkable progress that has been made in terms of expanding economic, social, technological and defense aspects of the U.S.-India relationship.

As Modi departed India, he reaffirmed the significance of the trip: “I am confident that my visit to the [U.S.] will reinforce our ties based on shared values of democracy, diversity, and freedom. Together we stand stronger in meeting the shared global challenges.”

What are the difficult topics that might be on the table, and how are Biden and Modi likely to navigate these?

Singh: Biden and Modi are determined to take U.S.-India relations to a new level with this visit, and part of having a mature strategic partnership is the ability to tackle difficult issues and areas of disagreement.

Issues that get a lot of media attention include policy differences on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and issues of human rights and democracy. More below-the-radar are key regional challenges like Afghanistan and Myanmar; enduring difficulties in a bilateral trade agenda; and finding a way to cooperate more on global governance, especially regulation of technology and the digital economy.

India will also seek progress in easing visas for Indian citizens, especially student visas and H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers, and U.S. commitments to greater technology sharing needed to implement the high-tech cooperation the leaders have rolled out.

A major change over the past decade is that the United States and India can now disagree on some issues and continue to work together on a large shared agenda. Given the strong personal bond Biden and Modi seem to have developed, expect them to be direct and forthright with one another in private and broadly supportive and celebratory in public.

On issues like Ukraine, intense private consultations will likely touch on assessments of the state of the conflict and the need to ensure Putin does not turn to nuclear weapons. Biden may seek Modi’s assessment of Putin and possible paths Russia might take to end the war. On Afghanistan, Modi and Biden may share assessments of Taliban, al-Qaida, ISIS and Pakistan-based militant threats since the U.S. withdrawal. India has kept a small diplomatic presence in Afghanistan and may encourage the United States to engage more actively to partner in preventing terrorism in and from the region.

Democracy and human rights, which get the most media attention, will not be avoided, but expect a similar pragmatic approach. U.S. leaders are concerned about democracy everywhere — including at home. Biden has taken an inclusive view that all democracies face challenges and that leaders of democracies should work together to improve durable democratic development. That will likely be the approach with India. U.S. leaders will welcome public comments or gestures from Modi in support of pluralistic democracy, but do not believe that lecturing India on these issues can be effective. A logical takeaway is that the United States will handle human rights concerns with India more like it does with a country like Poland.

First and foremost, Biden and Modi both pursue the interests of their own citizens, and they seem to understand each other on this basis. For Modi, this means development and meeting the basic needs of 1.4 billion people by transforming India into a modern, global technology powerhouse that competes with China. For Biden it means rebuilding the American middle class and maintaining America’s global leadership. Underneath the lofty rhetoric about two great democracies, these leaders see pragmatic benefits for their own people coming from deeper social, economic, political and security ties. They will manage the hard stuff to protect those gains.

How might the outcomes of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s recent trip to India shape conversations on defense and technology?

Lalwani: Austin’s trip to New Delhi two weeks ago helped finalize agreements and set the table for Modi’s historic state visit to Washington. The 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy called for more technology cooperation with allies and partners, which produced greater technology-sharing mechanisms with Australia (through the AUKUS deal with the United Kingdom) as well as with Japan. Now the United States appears poised to take some unprecedented steps toward the third partner in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, India.

U.S. technology cooperation with India is likely to include co-production and technology sharing of General Electric engines, which will be used in Indian military fighter jets to deter and defend against China. Additional Defense Department efforts involve a defense industrial cooperation roadmap to expedite co-production of military equipment; new programs to network both countries entrepreneurs, research labs, industry, and venture capital fueling defense innovations over the medium term; and enhanced scientific collaboration on emerging technologies in artificial intelligence, synthetic biology and robotics.

The strategic result will be twofold — enhanced Indian deterrence and greater trust in U.S.-India defense collaboration. First, in the near to medium term, India will be able to augment its military capabilities to defend against Chinese aggression, which ratcheted up with the Galwan crisis and clashes during the summer of 2020. The defense industrial roadmap involves four focus areas for fast-tracking technology cooperation: air combat and land mobility systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR); munitions; and the undersea domain awareness (UDA).

As India is able to quickly develop better ISR assets, it will be able to identify the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) maneuvers or gray zone incursions on their disputed continental border much earlier. Similarly, better UDA will enable India to better discern and track Chinese submarine activity in the Indian Ocean, and share that data with friends and partners. With both, detection will play a critical role in deterrence. Greater land mobility systems will help India to quickly surge forces and supplies to flashpoints along the disputed border with China, while longer range munitions can threaten to interdict PLA supply lines in the event of a conflict.

The second expected result of this technology sharing effort can be greater mutual trust in order to enhance collaboration in the Indo-Pacific. The trust generated from top-down and bottom-up technology cooperation may be less tangible yet is more significant. India has made no secret of its decades-long desire for a high-technology partnership, and the great lengths the U.S. government has gone to fulfill this deserve serves as a costly signal of its commitment and reliability. With this mutual trust, both partners will be better able to engage in more advanced joint assessments, contingency planning, and exercises as they prepare to backstop each other, interoperate together, and share the burdens of deterring aggression and securing the Indo-Pacific commons.

What are the most pressing issues the United States and India will be focused on when it comes to China?

Markey: The bedrock for cooperation between the United States and India lies in a shared interest in deterring Chinese territorial aggression and challenging the extension of China’s political influence and military presence in India’s backyard.

The most immediate concern is along the Line of Actual Control, the contested China-India land border, where China has made vast investments in military infrastructure that have already enabled it to push India from former patrolling points and could, in a worst-case scenario, even enable large-scale incursions into Indian territory. U.S. officials are eager to help India reinforce its own capacity to deter and defend against such attacks, as they pose a genuine near-term threat to Indian security and represent a dangerous precedent that could intimidate other less powerful states across the Indo-Pacific region. U.S. defense sales to India are intended to fill immediate capability gaps (for instance, to improve border surveillance with U.S.-made drones) as well as to co-manufacture future weapon systems (such as fighter jet engines).

Also of concern to both Washington and New Delhi is the rapid growth of China’s navy. Although China’s military is disproportionately focused on challenges along the nation’s eastern seaboard, especially Taiwan and the South and East China Seas, the rapid modernization and expansion of its fleet enables operations across the Indian Ocean as well. U.S. officials aim to explore cooperative ventures with India that will enable better monitoring of and response to Chinese maritime activities.

Finally, whereas in the past Indian officials jealously perceived U.S. involvement in South Asia as a threat to India’s regional hegemony, now New Delhi is increasingly eager to see Washington play an active economic and political role in neighboring states across the region, such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, as a means to counterbalance Chinese influence."

Joe Biden said on a visit to New Delhi in 2006. They may not be quite there yet, but Biden is doing everything to ensure they end up much closer—especially economically and militarily—after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits next week.

“My dream is that in 2020, the two closest nations in the world will be India and the United States,” then-Sen. Joe Biden said on a visit to New Delhi in 2006. They may not be quite there yet, but Biden is doing everything to ensure they end up much closer—especially economically and militarily—after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits next week.

Washington is rolling out the red carpet for Modi, hosting him for a state dinner, the Biden administration’s third such visit after welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol within the past year. Modi will also address a joint session of Congress, his second time doing so as Indian prime minister.

It’s not just pomp and symbolism, however. The United States wants to bring India deeper into its manufacturing and defense orbit, with the added benefit of helping wean New Delhi’s military off Russia and U.S. supply chains off China. Although both sides have been tight-lipped on planned announcements, a number of expected agreements on semiconductor chips and fighter jet engines have been in the works for months, bolstered by visits to New Delhi by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in the weeks leading up to Modi’s trip. This week, the two sides reportedly sealed a deal for India to buy more than two dozen American drones.

“While I will not spill the beans, I can tell you that the ceremonial and substantive parts of the visit will fully complement each other and will be unparalleled,” Taranjit Singh Sandhu, India’s ambassador to Washington, said at a recent event.

The India-U.S. relationship hasn’t always been smooth sailing, and potential frictions remain, but the two countries have increasingly zeroed in on an arena where they can achieve symbiosis. “If you ask me what I would bet on the most, what is that one force multiplier for this relationship, it is tech,” Sandhu said. “It is the master key to unlock the real potential in the relationship.”

Officials from both sides have spent months laying the groundwork—and acronyms. An initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET), launched in late January by Sullivan and his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval, commits to cooperation in areas such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, space exploration, semiconductors, and defense technology. There has been more movement on the last two in particular: U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal inked a bilateral semiconductor supply chain partnership in New Delhi in March, while Austin’s visit to New Delhi earlier this month yielded INDUS-X, or the India-U.S. Defense Acceleration Ecosystem, described by the Pentagon as a “new initiative to advance cutting-edge technology cooperation” between the two militaries.

The most significant developments are likely to take place on the defense front, particularly if recent discussions on jointly producing jet engines, long-range artillery, and military vehicles come to fruition next week, product of a yearslong rapprochement on sharing defense technology with India. “This is not just manufacturing in India, this is genuine tech transfer,” said Rudra Chaudhuri, director of New Delhi-based think tank Carnegie India. “That’s a big deal.”

In some ways, it is an opportunity for a marriage of convenience. About half of India’s military equipment is Russian-made, and although New Delhi has spent years trying to diversify that supply, Russia’s protracted war in Ukraine has increased the urgency of finding new bedfellows. Washington sees an opening.

“The one relationship which the U.S. has traditionally been wary of in closer defense ties with India has been the India-Russia partnership,” said Aparna Pande, director of the India Initiative at the Hudson Institute. “This is one chance where if India can be weaned away because of a lack of supply parts, problematic equipment, or Russia getting closer to China, [you can] maybe convince India to purchase more from the United States and U.S. partners and allies.”

China is another major source of mutual concern pushing Washington and New Delhi closer together. India’s relationship with China deteriorated earlier and far more dramatically, with military clashes on their shared border leading to an Indian purge of Chinese technology (including, notably, a TikTok ban) nearly three years ago. Chinese naval expansion into the Indian Ocean has also spooked India and reinforced the importance of the so-called Quad group of countries. The United States and its allies, meanwhile, are urgently trying to reorient and “friendshore” global tech supply chains to reduce dependence on China, which has spent years establishing itself as the world’s factory floor.

India presents a ready replacement in many ways, much of it stemming from its new status as the world’s most populous country. That means a large (and youthful) labor force, millions of whom are skilled engineers, and relatively low manufacturing costs that the Modi government is further bolstering with tax incentives under its signature “Make in India” program. Like China, India’s sheer size also presents a huge potential domestic market for U.S. companies, an advantage over other alternatives such as Vietnam and Mexico. If for decades dollars and cents determined the landscape of global technology production, geopolitics have become supreme.

“There’s a sense of Balkanization taking place” in the global tech supply chain, said Mukesh Aghi, CEO of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a Washington-based business advocacy group. “Geopolitical stress points are driving the tech agenda.”

There are still hurdles that need to be overcome, including India’s history of protectionism and red tape that has burned U.S. companies in the past and made it difficult to create the kind of manufacturing infrastructure required to rival what China has built. One large semiconductor push, a $19 billion joint venture between Indian conglomerate Vedanta and Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, has reportedly already been stymied by a denial of government incentives.

And while companies will ultimately have to vote with their checkbooks, Biden and Modi are sending nothing but boosterish signals.

“Remember the old saying that trade follows the flag—I think the two governments are waving the flag very mightily to show which direction industry and business ought to be going,” said Atul Keshap, a former diplomat who heads the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s U.S.-India Business Council. “The two governments tried for a long time to figure out what government-to-government interaction would look like, and now I think they’re realizing the value of letting the private sector collaborate,” he added.

But one casualty of the Modi visit and his newfound status will likely be U.S. willingness to call out concerns about the health of India’s democracy, at least publicly. The Biden administration has been increasingly reluctant to call out Modi’s crackdowns on free speech and violence against minorities, and experts say the strategic imperatives are too great to afford antagonizing a vital partnership.

“There is a desire to emphasize the strategic and the national security imperative over the domestic imperative,” Pande said. “In the current context, India is important, and so what the U.S. is preferring to do is convey a lot of what it wants to say in private and not in public.”"

Hundreds of activists are working to challenge the delicate choreography of controversial Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first state visit to the U.S. ― while risking backlash from the authoritarian strains within Modi’s movement, which are often hostile to criticism of their leader.

Modi, who arrived in the U.S. on Wednesday at President Joe Biden’s invitation, will receive a 21-gun welcome salute and a state dinner Thursday for the first time since becoming prime minister. Top lawmakers have also invited him to become the first-ever Indian leader to address two joint sessions of Congress.

The honors contrast with the treatment that U.S. critics of Modi’s rule say they are enduring: government intimidation, online trolling, legal harassment and effective bans on travel to India, where many of them still have family and friends. As Modi’s government has pressured journalists, human rights groups and opposition leaders at home, he and his allies are making it harder to draw attention to India’s alarming trajectory abroad, activists argue.

“Anyone who has roots in or ties to India is scared of the fact that a single word could result in reprisal,” said Raqib Hameed Naik, a journalist in exile in the U.S. who was born in the Indian-held portion of the disputed Kashmir region.

The challenge of questioning Modi’s movement even bedevils some of the most powerful players in the diaspora: leading Indian American politicians.

In 2019, India’s foreign minister refused to meet with Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) over her advocacy for Kashmir. Ahead of Modi’s current visit, Jayapal was the only one of five Indian Americans in Congress ― all House Democrats, who also include Ami Bera and Ro Khanna of California, Raja Krishnamoorthy of Illinois and Shri Thanedar of Michigan ― to sign a letter asking Biden to raise the issue of human rights with the prime minister.

“Elected officials are definitely reticent to make really strong remarks on India because they are afraid of this backlash,” said Ria Chakrabarty of Hindus for Human Rights.

A progressive congressional aide told HuffPost: “In some ways it’s harder to work on Modi than Palestine.”

Bera “raises human rights concerns directly in his conversations with Indian government officials,” a spokesperson wrote to HuffPost. One of the other lawmakers, who requested anonymity to protect relationships, said, “I’ll speak on human rights but didn’t think this was the right vehicle and neither did the White House.”

Modi’s critics want U.S. officials to engage with India and acknowledge its importance while urging the nation to abide by its stated commitment to democratic principles, including freedom of expression. Right now, they say, the Biden administration and legislators from both parties are giving Modi largely unadulterated praise that makes more rights violations inevitable and sustains an atmosphere of fear that hurts American citizens.

“Because there haven’t been consequences for the Indian government, they’re emboldened,” said Kiran Kaur Gill, the executive director of the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund.

According to advocates for a tougher U.S. approach to Modi, the retaliation against their work is driving some people in their movement to be less public or pull back altogether and disproportionately hurting communities who are already marginalized in India and the Indian diaspora, such as women and religious minorities. Eventually, the trend could have foreign policy ramifications, distorting America’s debate over a country that is an increasingly vital U.S. partner and a leader who seeks to grow even more powerful through a third term in office.

“There’s a desire for the U.S. and India to be stronger allies,” Gill said. “While there are obvious strategic reasons for that, that doesn’t take away from the fact that it’s still imperative to address these human rights issues, these issues of flouting democratic norms.”

Raising The Price Of Dissent

India elected Modi in 2014. His huge mandate and his pledges of rapid economic growth immediately drew international attention. But so did his disdain for dissenting voices, his promotion of Hindu nationalism in the diverse, historically secular country, and his role in huge anti-Muslim riots in 2002.

In office, Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have overseen raids on media organizations and nonprofits ― most recently the BBC ― and an increase in violence against Muslims and other Indian minorities. Additionally, the government has tightened control over Jammu and Kashmir, the country’s only Muslim-majority state, and meted out a record number of internet shutdowns while casting protesters and Modi’s political opponents as enemies of India.

“He’s a very rigid, authoritarian, communal and divisive leader who strongly believes in a no-questions-asked approach,” Naik said.

Naik has experienced how that approach is not limited to India’s borders.

After he covered Modi’s 2019 crackdown in Kashmir, Naik left for the U.S. in 2020, where he began running a hate crime tracker called Hindutva Watch. Since then, Indian authorities have contacted his parents 11 times to discuss his work, he said, in one instance summoning his father to an army camp. Former friends and colleagues stopped talking to Naik.

A year and a half ago, he received a phone call from someone claiming to be a senior police officer in India and saying he had a file on Naik, the reporter recalled. He later received a text message purportedly from a representative of India’s Intelligence Bureau asking when he was coming back to the country so the two could meet in person.

“The moment I will land in India, I’ll be in shackles,” Naik said.

“A lot of people in the diaspora who criticize Modi, they fear the same,” he continued, saying that feeling often spurs self-censorship.

India’s embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment for this article.

The Indian government can also use more subtle ways to punish critics internationally.

Many Indian Americans are worried about losing their Overseas Citizenship of India cards, a form of permanent visa. (India does not permit dual citizenship.) In 2021, the Indian government reportedly canceled OCI cards for people who supported demonstrations by farmers, and in 2019, it revoked the card from Aatish Taseer, a high-profile writer critical of Modi.

“If they can go after [Taseer], it’s a good signal,” Suchitra Vijayan, another writer, told HuffPost. “It’s almost impossible for people who are not as famous as him to actually fight …it sent such chilling shockwaves around the community.”

Rasheed Ahmed, the executive director of the Indian American Muslim Council, told HuffPost he had heard of Indian diplomats writing to individuals saying their cards needed to be reviewed.

“There is a considerable level of apprehension – beyond apprehension, fear – in the Indian Muslim community. If there is a protest, people say they don’t want to go,” Ahmed continued, noting community members’ anxieties about continued access to family members or business interests in India.

The effort to discourage criticism of Modi can blur the lines between India’s government, his political movement and his unofficial defenders.

In February, a Twitter account called @DisInfoLab attacked Sunita Viswanath, a U.S.-based activist who runs Hindus for Human Rights, as an agent of George Soros, the billionaire donor to good government watchdogs and liberal politicians who is a global bogeyman for conservatives. Earlier this month, prominent BJP operative Amit Malviya began recirculating the claim, tacking on a suggestion that Viswanath works with Indian nemesis Pakistan.

The overall environment is one of feeling watched and vulnerable, activists say, with people disturbed by Modi’s actions regularly assessing how they can safely channel their discontent ― given the potential danger that they or people close to them could face just because of something like a video of them circulating in pro-Modi WhatsApp groups.

Those feelings are amplified by signs that Modi supporters in India are cooperating with ultraconservative members of Indian immigrant communities to quash criticism, Chakrabarty noted. “People have experienced death threats from addressing quote unquote touchy issues within the diaspora,” she said, citing the example of a California state senator who sought to bar discrimination on the basis of the Hindu concept of caste. “These are pretty coordinated campaigns.”

In 2021, Vijayan’s organization, the Polis Project, worked on a conference titled Dismantling Global Hindutva that drew 1.8 million emails’ worth of complaints to universities and people involved in the project, she said, causing some participants to discuss calling the plan off for safety reasons.

“Imagine an academic conference held online and curated by predominantly American universities being intimidated in a way that they wanted to cancel,” Vijayan said.

Weathering Pro-Modi Storms

For many Modi observers, the work of boosting awareness about his policies and seeking American pressure for changes are too important to abandon.

“You cannot preempt authoritarian regimes ― you cannot stay silent because you think something might happen… I would also be very wary of just being silent,” Vijayan said.

Deepa Iyer, a longtime activist in the South Asian American community, sees a bright spot in the willingness of a broader range of groups to speak out about changes in India.

“The more people who speak out, the greater safety there is,” she said.

She and Chakrabarty noted how upper-caste Hindus are particularly conscious of their position. They may be more shielded from criticism or more focused on less visible activism, like trying to explain worrying developments to family members.

Another factor that organizers consider in community members’ willingness to speak out is whether their loved ones in India live in BJP-run states and what immigration status they hold in the U.S., Chakrabarty noted.

“We build towards this choir of voices … there’s real power when you’ve got a surge,” Iyer said.

Washington’s broader conversation about Modi echoes the discussions among activists in some ways: whether to be public or not on the issue of human rights.

Naik argued that the sense of intimidation he and other Modi critics feel shows the importance of clear U.S. action.

“This is a clear example of transnational repression,” he said, using a term the Biden administration frequently deploys in critiquing other nations’ approach to overseas critics. “They have taken action against the Chinese, they have taken action against the Iranians… unfortunately it has been the case that they only use [the relevant policies] against their adversaries.”

Biden’s team argues that private persuasion is the best way to encourage India to change course. In a call with reporters on Wednesday, a senior administration official said the president raises rights issues to Modi “with respect” and “humility,” acknowledging that the U.S. has its own shortcomings as a way to create “a dialogue based on mutual challenges rather than simply hectoring, lecturing or scolding.

“That kind of interaction, that kind of respectful approach, tends to be more effective,” the official said.

But the lack of concrete signs that Modi is easing his approach to minorities and critics leaves many observers unimpressed with that line ― and determined to keep raising the alarm despite the toll.

“If the general thinking is to address issues behind the scenes, it has clearly not worked,” Gill said.

A senior congressional aide described the letter from Jayapal and more than 70 other lawmakers as a symptom of confusion about Biden’s approach.

“There is not a clear public understanding of how the values discussion is figuring in the broader bilateral relationship with India. That’s both the U.S. administration’s fault but also the Indian government’s,” the aide said. “The internal struggle is how do you get India to move the ball on these issues… we should be talking about all of the things, and if there’s a clear sense that values is part of the broader discussion, then you’d see less of a public-facing criticism on human rights and democracy issues.”

Gill summarized the yearning for more visible action."

This visit is seen as a turning point for bilateral relations, focusing on deeper cooperation in the defence industry and the exchange of high technology.

It is Prime Minister Modi's first state visit to the US during his nine-year tenure. He will attend Yoga Day celebrations at the UN HQ in New York, hold talks with US President Joe Biden, and address the joint session of the US Congress in Washington DC.

These programmes include Yoga Day celebrations at the @UN HQ, talks with @POTUS @JoeBiden, address to the Joint Session of the US Congress and more. https://t.co/gRlFeZKNXR — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 20, 2023

There are several reasons why Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit is being considered historic:

It is his first state visit to the US. A state visit is the highest form of diplomatic courtesy extended by one country to another. It is a sign of the close relationship between the two countries.

PM Modi will become the only Indian Prime Minister to address a joint session of the US Congress twice. The Prime Minister had earlier addressed the US Congress in 2016.

The visit comes at a time when the US and India are looking to deepen their cooperation on a range of issues, including trade, defence, and climate change.

The two countries have a shared interest in maintaining a stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, and this visit is an opportunity to discuss how they can work together to achieve this goal.

Modi's US visit is likely to have a positive impact on the relationship between the two countries. Here's what all PM Modi will be doing during his 4-day US visit:

Deepening Indo-US partnership

Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his enthusiasm for his visit to the United States, emphasizing its potential to enhance the depth and diversity of the Indo-US partnership.

He regarded the special invitation from President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden for a state visit as a testament to the strength and vitality of the relationship between the two democracies.

Promoting bilateral cooperation

In his departure statement, PM Modi highlighted the significance of his discussions with President Biden and other senior US leaders. These deliberations will not only help solidify bilateral cooperation but also pave the way for collaborative efforts in forums such as G20, Quad, and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF).

Celebrating International Day of Yoga at the UN headquarters

Commencing his visit in New York, PM Modi will celebrate the International Day of Yoga on June 21 at the United Nations headquarters, accompanied by the UN leadership and members of the international community.

He expressed his anticipation for this special event, commemorating the location that supported India's proposal to establish an International Day of Yoga in December 2014.

Strengthening India-US ties across multiple sectors

PM Modi highlighted the multifaceted nature of the India-US relationship, which encompasses various sectors. The United States is India's largest trade partner in goods and services, with both countries collaborating closely in areas such as science and technology, education, health, defense, and security.

Initiatives like Critical and Emerging Technologies have further expanded cooperation in defence industrial cooperation, space, telecom, quantum, artificial intelligence, and biotech sectors.

Additionally, the two nations are working together to advance their shared vision of a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.

Engaging with business and Indian community

During his visit to the US, Prime Minister Modi expressed his intention to meet with business leaders, interact with the Indian community, and engage with thought leaders from diverse backgrounds.

The focus will be on deepening India-US ties in key sectors such as trade, commerce, innovation, technology, and strengthening global supply chains.

Addressing the US Congress and state banquet

Prime Minister Modi acknowledged the strong bipartisan support for India-US ties in the US Congress. As part of his visit, he will have the opportunity to address a joint session of the US Congress at the invitation of the Congressional leadership.

Furthermore, he will attend the state banquet hosted by President Biden and the First Lady, alongside numerous dignitaries.

Deals that India will be signing with the US during PM Modi's visit:

Defence

India will sign a deal to purchase 31 MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones from the US. These drones are unarmed but can be equipped with weapons and sensors. They will be used for surveillance and reconnaissance missions in the Indian Ocean region.

India's defence ministry approved the procurement of the drones few days back. India will buy 31 drones made by General Atomics worth over $3 billion.

They have a range of over 1,000 miles and can stay in the air for over 24 hours.

Space

India is expected to sign a deal with NASA to collaborate on a number of space projects, including the Artemis program, which is a human spaceflight program that aims to return humans to the Moon.

India is expected to contribute to the program by providing launch vehicles and other support services.

Trade

India and the US are expected to sign a trade agreement that will reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade between the two countries. This will boost trade and investment between the two countries.

Thousands gathered on the White House South Lawn ahead of the formal welcoming ceremony, listening to performances by violinist Vibha Janakiraman and the a cappella group Penn Masala as they waited for Modi’s arrival.

But as Biden fetes Modi, human rights advocates and some U.S. lawmakers are questioning the Democratic president’s decision to offer the high honor to a leader whose nine-year tenure over the world’s biggest democracy has been marked by a backslide in political, religious and press freedoms.

Biden administration officials say honoring Modi, the leader of the conservative Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is Diplomacy 101. The U.S.-India relationship will be vital in coming decades as both sides navigate an ascendant China and enormous challenges posed by climate change, artificial intelligence, supply chain resilience and other issues.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden will raise his concerns but will avoid lecturing the prime minister during their formal talks.

“The question of where politics and the question of democratic institutions go in India is going to be determined within India by Indians. It’s not going to be determined by the United States,” Sullivan said. “So what we can do is our part, and our part is to speak out on behalf of universal values.”

Among the major announcements to be made Thursday is an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones, according to senior Biden administration officials. The officials briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to preview the major agreements ahead of their formal announcement.

The Biden administration also is unveiling plans aimed at bolstering India’s semiconductor industry. U.S.-based Micron Technology has agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending $800 million and India funding the rest. U.S.-based Applied Materials is announcing it will launch a new semiconductor center for commercialization and innovation in India, and Lam Research, another semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will start a training program for 60,000 Indian engineers.

On the space front, India will sign on to the the Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space exploration cooperation among nations participating in NASA’s lunar exploration plans. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station next year.

The State Department will also announce plans to open consulates in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad, while India will reopen its consulate in Seattle.

Despite the major deals, the visit will be shadowed by concerns laid out by rights activists and lawmakers that question Modi’s commitment to democratic principles.

Modi has faced criticism over legislation amending the country’s citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalization for some migrants but excludes Muslims, a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists, and the recent conviction of India’s top opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modi’s surname.

In 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi’s visa to the U.S., citing concerns that, as chief minister of Gujarat, he did not act to stop communal violence during 2002 anti-Muslim riots that left more than 1,000 people dead. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.

Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar on Minnesota have said they will boycott Modi’s address on Thursday before a joint meeting of Congress. And a group of more than 70 lawmakers wrote Biden this week calling on him to use his meeting with Modi to raise concerns about the erosion of religious, press and political freedoms.

“It is an important country to me, and we must call out some of the real issues that are threatening the viability of of democracy in all of our countries,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who was born in India and helped organize the lawmakers’ letter. “If India continues to backslide, I think it will affect our ability to have a really strong relationship with the country.”

Biden and Modi have also had differences over Russia’s war in Ukraine. India abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and refused to join the global coalition against Russia. Since the start of the war, the Modi government has also dramatically increased its purchase of Russian oil.

White House officials note that there are signs of change in India’s relationship with Russia, which has long been New Delhi’s biggest defense supplier.

India is moving away from Russian military equipment, looking more to the U.S., Israel, the United Kingdom and other nations. Modi recently met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and has spoken out about his worries about the potential use of nuclear weapons by Russia.

State visits typically are reserved for America’s closest allies, but they also have been used in the past as a carrot to try to strengthen relationships with countries with which the United States has had complicated relationships.

President Barack Obama honored Chinese Presidents Hu Jintao in 2011 and Xi Jinping in 2015.

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter hosted Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran, and his wife for a state visit. That visit came about 15 months before the shah was overthrown in Iran’s Islamic Revolution.

Violent clashes between pro- and anti-shah demonstrators broke out just south of the White House, leading police to deploy tear gas as an official ceremony was underway on the South Lawn. The stinging tear gas wafted to the welcoming ceremony.

Carter later apologized to the shah for the “air pollution.”

Modi’s busy itinerary on Thursday includes an Oval Office meeting with Biden, his address to Congress and a lavish White House state dinner hosted by Biden and first lady Jill Biden.

Modi, who hasn’t taken part in a formal press conference in years, has agreed to participate in one with Biden, according to the White House. Typically, state visits include a news conference in which the leaders take questions from two members of the U.S. press and two from the visiting press corps.

Modi is to be honored at a State Department luncheon on Friday hosted by Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He also is scheduled to address members of the Indian diaspora before departing Washington.

“President Biden is invested in making sure we get this partnership between these two countries, between these two peoples, right,” Sullivan said, adding that this could “deliver benefits to both of our peoples and to the world as a whole in the decades to come.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States has been fruitful in making India sign a number of pacts with the United States. The future of technologies like OpenRAN wireless systems, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and high performance is going to be shaped by the visit of the PM to the United States, as rightly said by Rajeev Chandrashekhar, the minister of state for electronics and information technology.

The Prime Minister of India reached New York on June 20th. On June 21, the International Yoga Day function was led by PM Modi at the United Nations Secretariat. PM Modi then flew to Washington on June 22 for the Bilateral and state dinner. On June 23 the highlight was the lunch at the US state department. The diaspora event held at the Ronald Reagan Centre in Washington was the last important event marked by PM Modi during his visit to the United States.

These are the visit to foreign countries which are liked by a head of government, acting in a sovereign capacity. These visits are officially described as “Visit of [name of the state]” and not “Visit of [name of leader]”. A state visit to the United States can only be possible when the president of the United States, acting in the capacity of the head of the state, formally invites the other state.

The Joint Statement asserted that “no corner of human enterprise is untouched by the partnership between our two great countries, which spans the seas to the stars”.

The Joint Statement issued by both India and the United States has asserted a vision of the two nations as “among the closest partners in the world- a partnership of democracies looking into the 21st century with hope, ambition, and confidence.”

The visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stressed a “next-generation partnership” between the two countries, India and the United States, with confidence, ambition, and hope. Here are the agreements signed and concerns raised between the two countries, as part of the India- U.S. Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership.

1. Defense

There have been several initiatives undertaken by the two countries in the area of defense partnership. These are:

Memorandum of understanding between GE Aerospace and HAL

A memorandum of understanding has been signed between GE Aerospace and HAL for the production of fighter jet engines for Light Combat Aircraft. The agreement contained the potential joint production of F4141 engines of GE Aerospace in India. The involvement of GE in the Light Combat Aircraft program and its collaboration on the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft were emphasized.

Repair and service of US Navy ships

The United States Navy has concluded with Larsen and Toubro Shipyard in Kattupalli (Chennia) a Master Ship Repair Agreement (MSRA) and is also concluding agreements with the Mazagon Dock Limited in Mumbai and the Goa Shipyard. These agreements will enable US Navy ships to undergo repair and service at Indian shipyards, in between their voyage.

General Atomics MQ-9Bs

India aims at procuring armed MQ-9B Sea Guardian UAVs. These drones will be enhancing India’s surveillance, intelligence, as well as reconnaissance abilities.

The INDUS-X and Defense Acceleration Ecosystem

The India-United States Defence Acceleration Ecosystem INDUS-X, was launched with an aim to encourage collaboration between tech companies and start-ups of India and the United States. Technologies from 10 United States start-ups and 15 Indian start-ups in areas such as AI, maritime, space, and autonomous systems were showcased at the system.

Collaboration opportunities in the area of deep-tech innovations, especially in the AI domains were stressed upon.

2. Citizen-centric efforts

A myriad of efforts that have a direct impact on the people has also been discussed and agreed upon by the two countries.

Visa Renewal Program and Consulate Openings

A program for domestic visa renewal for some petition-based temporary workers was set forth. The aim of the program is to organize the visa process and also potentially incorporate skilled visas such as the L visas and H1b. Two fresh United States consulates in Ahmedabad and Bengaluru were planned. India will be reopening its consulates in Seattle and declaring new consulates elsewhere.

Energy Collaboration

India and the United States are going to continue to work jointly to hit their national energy and climate goals. India’s decision to co-lead the Hydrogen Breakthrough Agenda was also welcomed by the United States.

3. Technology

The two countries realize the importance of technological advancements and thus a series of agreements have been signed in this direction.

Deliverables and Investments

The visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has led to a wide array of deliverables across health, mobility, defense, mobility, and critical and emerging technology. The two leaders affirmed that technology is going to play a key role in strengthening the partnership. The inauguration of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) in January 2023 is seen as an important milestone between the two countries. The US-India Commercial Dialogue will be launching a new “Innovation Handshake” to connect the startup ecosystem of India and the United States, with the purpose to support the US-India Initiatives on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET).

Micron Technology, Inc.

Micron Technology Inc. is all set to make investments in a test facility and new chip assembly in the state of Gujarat, supported by the Gujarat government and the Central Government.

Critical Minerals Partnership

India has successfully become a partner of the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) led by the United States which has been set to boost the development of diverse and sustainable critical energy minerals supply chains all over the globe.

4. Space Co-operations between the two countries

State cooperation between the two countries was also fostered when India joined a framework for the purpose of space exploration and assented to a mission to International Space Station in the year 2024. As per the website of the Ministry of External Affairs of India, the United States appreciated India’s growing cooperation in areas of space technologies and space science. The decision of NASA and ISRO to design a strategic framework by the end of the year 2023, for human spaceflight cooperation. The announcement by NASA to offer advanced training to Indian astronauts with the aim of fostering a joint effort to the International Space Station in the year 2024 was also hailed. The NASA-ISRO SYntehtic Aperture Radar’s delivery to ISRO’s U.R. Rao Satellite Centre in Bengaluru, India was also celebrated by the two countries.

5. Concerns, shared values, and more

Many concerns were raised in relation to PM Modi’s tenure as a Chief Minister of Gujarat, along with issues of democratic backsliding in the country. Around 70 lawmakers wrote to the United States President, in order to urge him to address human rights and democratic norms during the discussions with the Indian Prime Minister.

Additionally, US former President Barack Obama appealed to Prime Minister Modi to safeguard the ethnic minorities in India. Both leaders emphasized the importance of diversity, equity, power of example, and democracy.

6. Strategic Trade Dialogue

U.S. President Biden and Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi committed to encouraging policies and incorporating regulations that help facilitate better technology sharing, co-production, and co-development opportunities between the industries of both countries. The launch of the Strategic Trade Dialogue in the month of June 2023, which pushed both sides to take regular attempts to address export controls, and explore methods of fostering high-technology commerce was also welcomed by the leaders.

In an unprecedented build-up, the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon are rhapsodising in unison about the Modi visit in anticipation. Key members of the Biden cabinet and politicians across the aisle have literally exhausted adjectives and hyperboles, branding the forthcoming visit by PM Modi as “transformative, historic, pathbreaking.”



The ceremonial part of the visit—with all the bells and whistles—will be captivating and breathtaking. PM Modi will be welcomed at the White House on the morning of 22 June with a 21-gun salute, with a record number of Indian-Americans in attendance. The Biden administration has pulled out all stops to make the Modi visit memorable and substantive in terms of optics as well as outcomes. PM Modi will be only the third state visitor of the Biden administration, after French President Emmanuel Macron in December 2022 and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in April 2023. Modi will also become the first Indian leader to address the joint session of the US Congress on 22 June, for the second time.



With so much hype and frenzy, the big question is whether the 20-23 June visit by PM Modi to the US will live up to grand expectations. Sceptics may scoff and cynics may cavil, but if one looks at the sheer ambition and breadth of the agenda, this is one of those rare occasions where the results may actually surpass the hype. The deliverables that will be unveiled after the talks between PM Modi and US President Joe Biden at the White House on 22 June, will be truly transformational and revolutionary in its long-term impact and ramifications.

NEW ENGINE,

NEW JOURNEY

The centrepiece of PM Modi’s visit to the US will be a pathbreaking agreement between General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) to co-manufacture jet engines in India. Co-manufacturing of GE F414 jets, which will be used to power future fighter jets such as the Tejas Mark 2, promises to be a game-changer for India’s quest to indigenize its defence-industrial complex.



The long-term impact of the jet engine deal will be the acceleration of the removal of technology-related barriers. In a sign of things to come, President Biden is driving the deal from the front, instructing officials to remove unnecessary obstacles and barriers to deepen defence, trade and technology cooperation with India. The transfer of technology that is likely to occur will have multiple ripple effects on the country’s domestic defence industry, buttressing India’s capacity to not only manufacture weapons for domestic needs, but also enhance its capacity to export to friendly countries of the Global South. Strategically, the jet engine deal will bolster India’s deterrence against Chinese aggression and accelerate the rise of India as a major Asian and global power.



Defence ties are poised for exponential growth, with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) approving a deal to acquire 31 weaponised MQ-9 Reaper drones—15 for the Navy and eight each for the Army and the Air Force. The drone deal is expected to strengthen India’s defence against China in the Indian Ocean Region, along its land borders, especially with regard to China providing Pakistan with armed Cai Hong-4 and Wing Loong-II drones. These drones can also be used to strengthen monitoring of Chinese military activities along the Line of Actual Control and the long-standing confrontation in Eastern Ladakh.

DEFENCE INNOVATION BRIDGE

The big takeaway of PM Modi’s visit to the US will be the removal of barriers and regulations to facilitate India’s emergence as a fulcrum of global technology supply chains. Ahead of the Modi visit, the two-day INDUS-X initiative will be launched, which will bring the defence and tech startups of the two countries in a web of technology and expertise sharing to build a defence innovation bridge. In another transformational deal, the two sides are expected to sign a pact on the setting up of semiconductor supply chains in India, which will help reduce increased global dependence on China for semi-conductor manufacturing.

ROAD AHEAD:

NEXT STEPS

China will be the elephant in the room when President Biden and PM Modi sit down for talks in the White House on 22 June. Curbing China’s aggressive posturing and rules-altering behaviour in contested geographies such as the South China Sea will figure in the discussions. From defence deals to semi-conductors, India and the US will be looking to challenge China’s ambitions. Looking ahead, the real big deal of the Modi visit will be the liberation of India from technology constraints that have hobbled the growth potential of the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The civil nuclear deal struck in the summer of 2005 was the defining moment that converted the once estranged democracies into engaged democracies, setting the stage for rapid transformation of India-US relations over the next few years. The nuclear deal enhanced India’s international stature by bringing India into the global nuclear tent, but nearly a decade and a half later, the nuclear deal is still a work in progress. This is why the summer of 2023 is the watershed moment in India-US relations, with both sides finally overcoming “hesitations of history,” in PM Modi’s famous words to the US Congress in 2016, to script the next big steps in the world’s fastest-growing strategic partnership.

Aside from the pomp and symbolism associated with a State visit, the two sides are firming up engagements between Modi and US President Joe Biden to pave the way for closer alignment between the economic and technology ecosystems of the two countries and eliminating hurdles to building more resilient supply chains, the people said.

The external affairs ministry on Friday announced that Modi will visit the US during June 20-24, when he will be hosted by Biden at the White House and address a joint session of the Congress. This is only the third State visit hosted by Biden, following those for French President Emmanuel Macron and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.

The ministry said Modi will travel from the US to Egypt during June 24-25 to meet President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and build on trade and strategic relations between the two sides. This will be Modi’s first visit to Egypt.

Modi’s State visit to the US, at the invitation of Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, will commence in New York, where the Prime Minister will lead celebrations marking the International Day of Yoga at the UN headquarters on June 21.

Thereafter, Modi will travel to Washington, where he will be given a ceremonial welcome at the White House on June 22. Unlike past such welcomes, more than a thousand people are expected to be at the event, including members of the diaspora.

Modi will then hold a high-level dialogue with the US President. Biden and the First Lady will host a State dinner in honour of Modi the same evening. Several hundred guests, a mix of members of Congress, diplomats and celebrities, are expected to be at the dinner, the people said.

At the invitation of Congressional leaders, including speaker Kevin McCarthy of the House of Representatives and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Modi will address a joint sitting of the Congress on June 22. Addresses to joint sessions of Congress are reserved for the closest allies of the US or major world figures. Modi last made such an address in 2016.

On June 23, Modi will be jointly hosted at a luncheon by vice-president Kamala Harris and secretary of state Antony Bilnken. The people said the two sides are exploring the possibility of more interactions between Modi and Biden, besides the ones that have already been slotted, in order to allow the two leaders to spend the maximum amount of time together.

In addition to the official engagements, Modi is scheduled to have several curated interactions with CEOs, professionals and other stakeholders. He will also meet members of the Indian diaspora, the external affairs ministry said.

HT reported most of the engagements announced in the official schedule over the past two weeks.

Modi’s visit to the US is being seen as the high point in India’s calendar for bilateral engagements ahead of the G20 Summit in September, for which Biden is expected to travel to New Delhi. Several important deals, including one for India’s planned acquisition of 31 weaponised drones and another on closer collaboration on semiconductors, are expected to be unveiled during the visit to the US.

The people said there is genuine interest on both sides to use the visit to take relations to the next level. In this context, they pointed to back-to-back visits to India by secretary of state Blinken, commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, defence secretary Lloyd Austin and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.

The people also pointed to forward movement under new frameworks such as the initiative for Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET) and the Strategic Trade Dialogue, which paved the way for interlinking supply chains and facilitating cooperation in critical technologies such as AI and quantum computing, trade and investment.

“We have been talking to US stakeholders, both private players and regulators, to create greater linkages in manufacturing, services and technology. We are also evolving standards for critical technologies,” one of the people said.

While the people declined to confirm specific defence deals or other agreements, they pointed to how India-US ties in this realm had moved from a buyer-seller relationship to building a long-term technology and security partnership, including more complex military exercises and co-development of platforms.

The people acknowledged that the Ukraine war and its economic impact on developing countries and the role of China in the Indo-Pacific are likely to figure during discussions on regional and global issues, but made it clear that the frame of reference for the Prime Minister’s visit is purely bilateral.

Modi will subsequently travel to Cairo to pay a State visit to Egypt at the invitation of President Sisi. The invitation was extended to Modi in January when Sisi attended the Republic Day celebrations as chief guest.

Apart from holding talks with Sisi, Modi is likely to interact with senior dignitaries from the Egyptian government, prominent personalities and the Indian community.

Relations between India and Egypt are based on ancient trade and economic linkages and cultural and people-to-people ties, the external affairs ministry said. During Sisi’s state visit in January, the two countries agreed to elevate their relationship to a strategic partnership.

132,https://thefederal.com/explainers-2/explainer-whats-special-about-pm-modis-visit-to-the-us-this-time/,Explainer: What's special about PM Modi's visit to the US this time?,2023-06-08 12:00:00+05:30,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited the US multiple times for bi-lateral and multi-lateral meetings since the beginning of his tenure in 2014. But, this visit assumes a lot of signifance because none of his visits earlier to the US were classified as a ‘state visit’.

For a state visit is considered as the highest ranked visit by a head of the government of a state.

Modi’s earlier visits fell under the category of a working visit (2014), working lunch (2016) and official working visit (2017). While, his 2019 visit has been described by the US officially, as one in which Modi “Participated in a rally in Houston, Texas”.

On June 21, Modi will travel to the US on his first state visit at the invitation of President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. All eyes are on Modi’s high-profile visit to the US predicted by political analysts to be a “significant milestone” in the India US bilateral relationship.

Here’s why all eyes are on Modi’s state visit to the US on June 21 to June 24:

Why is this visit different?

This is said to be Modi’s first state visit to the US during his nine-year long reign as PM. This means that US President Joe Biden will host Modi during his visit and he will be offered a room for four days and three nights at Blair House, the President’s official guest house, located within walking distance of the White House.

What are state visits?

It is the highest ranked visit and are accorded to America’s closest allies and friends. It is to be differentiated from other kinds of visits accorded to a ranking member of a foreign government like an “official visit,” an “official working visit,” a “working visit,” and a “private visit.” The “state visit” , the highest ranking visit can only be offered to a chief of state – such as the President of a country or a reigning monarch – and must be at the invitation of the US President.

It is the highest expression of friendly bilateral relations and is full of official public ceremonies. It is a visit of a state rather than visit of a leader.

What will the state visit involve?

In short, a state visit ensures a meeting with the US President, a state dinner at the White House, a full honors arrival and departure ceremony on the south grounds of the White House, and a 21 gun salute. Gifts may be exchanged and spouses can attend the ceremonies and dinners.

On June 22, the US President and his wife will host a state dinner. Earlier, on the south lawns of the White House, President Biden and the First Lady will welcome the Indian Prime Minister amid a 21-gun salute. The White House has sent out invitations for the welcome ceremony, which many Indian Americans were clambering to be invited to.

This invitation reportedly marks the first time a country-specific diaspora has been invited to the White House in such large numbers, said news reports.

Why is this visit important?

According to political analysts, Modi has been invited for several bilateral and multilateral meetings with American Presidents in the past, but this official ‘state visit’ accompanied with a state dinner before the G20 Summit in September, is a signal that the US considers India to be an equal partner. The first Indian Prime Minister to receive a state dinner at the White House was Jawaharlal Nehru in October 1949, after which many Indian PMs have been invited to enjoy a sumptuous meal at the White House.

The visit is also meant to strengthen the two countries’ “shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific” and their shared resolve to elevate their strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space, said official releases by the two countries.

Why is US wooing India?

At another level, the visit is important for the US as it tries to counter China’s growing clout and wants to possibly shift its investments to India, said experts. According to political scientists, the Biden administration is “desperately courting India” because they need a potential counter to China, for the purpose of establishing a “global supply chain and for investment reasons.”

This visit can also provide an opening for the US to urge India to openly condemn Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“We look forward to hosting Indian Prime Minister @NarendraModi in June, whose visit will celebrate the deep partnership between the United States and India,” US Secretary of Stae, Anthony Blinken tweeted recently, weeks before Modi’s visit.

While John Kirby, White House National Security Council spokesperson told reporters recently on June 6, two weeks before Modi’s visit, “India is a strong partner of US at very many levels.” He cited additional defence cooperation deals, “lot of economic trade”, and for India being a member of the Quad and a key partner and friend of Indo-Pacific security.

“There’s innumberable reasons why India certainly matters not just bilaterally between the two of our nations, but multi-laterally on many multiple levels,” he stressed.

Analysts believe that the US is looking for a location for its manufacturing. The classic case often given is of Apple, which has launched manufacturing in India and is expected to export 20 million iPhone 14s. There are a lot of other companies also looking from that perspective, said experts. There’s also a key General Electric deal in the offing, which involves building GE engines that will power HAL’s Tejas-Mk II Light Combat Aircraft.

The signing of the MoU with General Electric will be one of the biggest deliverable of Prime Minister Modi’s State visit to the US, said news reports. With bilateral trade reaching a record-breaking $191 billion last year, the US-India Business Council (USIBC) will host the INDUS-X conference scheduled to be held over two days in Washington to coincide with Modi’s visit. INDUS-X is a platform for start-ups and enterprises from both countries to identify collaborations for high-tech innovations within the ambit of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET).

Why is this visit important for Modi?

‘Diaspora diplomacy’ has been one of Modi’s key political strategies since he was the Gujarat Chief Minister. This US visit is crucial for Modi’s global image, to show off India’s global grandstanding and to send the message back home that Modi as the leader has accomplished this. This is important for Modi before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

One of the highlights of Modi’s visit to the US?

Modi will address a joint session of the US Congress during his state visit to Washington DC on June 22, becoming the only Indian PM to address the joint sitting of the US Congress twice.

The Congressional leaders invited Modi “on behalf of the bipartisan leadership of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate”, to address a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday, June 22. It will be the second time that Modi will address a joint meeting of the US Congress, the first being in 2016. At that time, he was the fifth Indian PM to address the joint session of US Congress, the others being Manmohan Singh (2005), Atal Bihari Vajpayee (2000), PV Narasimha Rao (1994) and Rajiv Gandhi (1985).

Other key activities on Modi’s US visit agenda?

On the agenda are agreements on trade, defence and critical minerals and significant progression of the Indo-US defence partnership, with the signing of a joint production agreement.

Ahead of Modi’s state visit, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in India on a two-day visit to explore ways to lay the groundwork for highly anticipated agreements on bilateral defence cooperation, especially in areas of transfer of critical technologies for co-development of military hardware.

What are the events organised by the Indian diaspora?

Multiple events have been planned to extend a grand welcome to Modi.

An ‘India Unity Day’ march is being planned from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC to welcome Modi, two days before Modi’s arrival in America.

Other such marches are being planned in 20 other places, including New York’s Times Square and San Francisco’s Golden Bridge. A group of Indian Americans will be at the Andrews Air Force Base to welcome Modi as he lands on June 21 afternoon in New York. While hundreds of the community members will gather at Lafayette Square Park in front of the White House.

The Indian diaspora has planned “a cultural event spanning Kashmir to Kanyakumari, and West to East in front of the White House”, to showcase the growth of India during Modi’s term in the past nine years.

News reports said that Modi may well lead the International Yoga Day celebrations on June 21 in New York.

Who’s organising these events?

The Overseas Friends of BJP (OFBJP) USA, along with other right-wing organisations such as the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh, which has approximately 205 local chapters, including in college campuses will organise these events.

This same groups had organised Modi’s meeting at New York’s Madison Square Garden in 2014 and the “Howdy Modi” jamboree in Texas featuring Modi and Donald Trump in 2019. Many people flocked to these events and chanted Modi’s name giving him a rockstar reception. It is said that crowd of over 50,000 people was present when Modi and Trump jointly addressed the ‘Howdy Modi!’ gathering in Houston, Texas."

Stepping on the American soil, he led the ninth International Yoga Day celebrations and addressed an event hosted by US first lady Jill Biden at the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Washington.

He also engaged with a diverse array of influential people, among the most notable names include Tesla CEO Elon Musk. However, his meetings didn’t end here. Some reports suggest that CEOs of prominent companies such as Apple, FedEx and Marriott are invited to the state dinner organised by President Joe Biden at the White House.

With this, India is gaining the attention of global corporations as they seek new sources of labour and revenue in the midst of the US’ efforts to find an alternative to China. It also signals that Indian prime minster is really driven to improve the business environment and India is open for business.

High on the agenda will be removing regulatory constraints to doing business, particularly in the tech space, encouraging more American companies to consider investing in India.

Modi referred to the relationship as the “sun in the new dawn” that would bring light to the world. He highlighted India’s economic growth, noting that it had risen from the tenth largest economy to the fifth largest and is on track to become the third largest. Modi emphasized that when India prospers, the world prospers, given its significant population and potential for inspiring growth in other countries.

The Prime Minister outlined India’s focus on infrastructure development, including providing millions of homes and implementing a national health insurance program that covers hundreds of millions of people. He also mentioned India’s efforts in financial inclusion, digital technology, and COVID-19 vaccination, highlighting the scale and impact of these initiatives. Modi emphasized the importance of India’s growth to the United States, citing how defense and aerospace collaborations lead to job creation and the positive effects of investment by American companies in India.

Furthermore, Modi called for reforms in multilateral institutions, advocating for better representation and resources. He expressed India’s commitment to working with the United States in various areas, including space, science, technology, trade, and humanitarian efforts. The Prime Minister concluded by affirming that India and the US would be partners in building a new world order based on international law.

Modi addressed the Joint session of US Congress, and attends state dinner. At the White House, corporate executives attending the event included Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, Alphabet Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft Corp. chief Satya Nadella. They were joined by celebrities including Billie Jean King and Ralph Lauren at the third state dinner of Biden’s presidency.

135,https://www.cfr.org/blog/modis-state-visit-us-litmus-test-values-based-us-trade-policy,Modi’s State Visit to the U.S. Is a Litmus Test for Values-Based U.S. Trade Policy,,"The Joe Biden administration is ramping up its efforts to woo India as a reliable strategic partner in advance of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to Washington this week. Last week, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan prepared for the visit in New Delhi, meeting with his counterparts to identify possible outcomes and lay the groundwork for future cooperation on critical and emerging technologies. Meanwhile, in Washington, Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the U.S.-India Business Council Ideas Summit, “on the eve of what we believe will be a historic state visit by Prime Minister Modi—one that will further solidify what President Biden has called the ‘defining relationship’ of the 21st century.”

While security issues will feature prominently, trade will also be high on the agenda as the United States seeks to strengthen economic ties with the world’s most populous country. The United States is India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade surpassing $190 billion last year. However, significant barriers to trade remain, and both countries should use Modi’s state visit as an opportunity to tackle major trade irritants and pave the way for a more comprehensive trade dialogue in the near future.

Historically, the two countries have not seen eye to eye on international economic affairs, and trade links between them have suffered as a result. Recently, Raj Kumar Singh, India’s minister for power and renewable energy, criticized the Biden administration’s signature climate initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act, as pure protectionism that disadvantages developing countries unable to subsidize their own transition to green energy.

But India is no stranger to protectionism. Last year, India applied a 40 percent tariff on solar panel imports, which it is considering slashing in half after a shortfall in domestic capacity. On trade, India consistently acts against its own interests, fiercely opposing plurilateral negotiations at the World Trade Organization on digital trade and investment facilitation. India has also opted out of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework’s trade pillar, the Biden administration’s signature trade initiative. The United States should push India to participate in these talks, but also indicate that a bilateral trade agreement is not only possible, but desired. Of course, the Biden administration has shown little appetite for trade agreements, and has instead favored trade executive agreements that offer little in the way of binding and enforceable rules.

Despite this, there is still ample opportunity to improve U.S.-India trade relations. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has stated that “the United States is pursuing a policy called ‘friendshoring’ to deepen integration with our trusted trading partners,” and has identified India among them. However, if the Biden administration wants to send a strong signal to India that it is a trusted economic ally, it should start by lifting Donald Trump–era tariffs on steel and aluminum that were imposed in the name of national security. If India is a friend trusted with critical supply chains, then importing steel and aluminum from India should not be viewed as a security threat. While India’s steel sector is very carbon-intensive and will require both domestic and international coordination to reach its decarbonization goals, the United States could help those efforts through technical assistance and by inviting India into the green steel club it is developing with the European Union.

Another way that the United States could advance economic ties with India would be to renew the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, which provided duty-free access to a range of imports from developing countries. The Trump administration removed India from the program in 2019 for failing to provide market access, just a year before the program itself expired. India had been the largest beneficiary of GSP until its removal, and 12 percent of its exports to the United States in 2018 were done under its auspices.

While the GSP program did not make up a significant amount of U.S. imports (just 0.8 percent in 2020), for many developing countries, it provided critical access to the U.S. market and helped contribute to global poverty reduction. President Biden should assure India that its GSP status will be reinstated after Congress has renewed the program, and Congress should act swiftly to pass a GSP bill that avoids stringent new conditions.

At the same time, the U.S.-India relationship needs to remain reciprocal, and the United States should demand more from India as it seeks to turn the page and deepen economic ties. During a meeting in September 2021, Modi declared that the importance of “democratic values, traditions to which both countries are committed … will only increase further.” Biden echoed this sentiment, but emphasized that both countries have “a shared responsibility to uphold democratic values.”

However, aside from these platitudes, U.S. officials have been mum on India’s democratic backsliding. Some experts suggest that the United States should be honest about its alliance of convenience with India, which they argue is about countering China instead of “seeking an imaginary relationship based on values.” Others have pointed out that the democratic values that underpin the U.S.-India relationship are important for stable economic relations and help U.S. businesses seeking to invest there.

The bigger question is what kind of geoeconomic order the United States wants to encourage. If Jake Sullivan’s speech at the Brookings Institution is taken at face value, one would assume that “repairing faith in democracy” is at the heart of economic renewal and opportunity. But the United States should not only do the hard work of renewing faith in democracy at home—it should also expect its allies to be equally committed. Absent this, any efforts at values-based economic deepening or friendshoring will be perceived as mere window dressing to our allies, and as evidence to China that U.S. concerns about its rise have less to do with authoritarianism than with economic competition. Modi’s visit to Washington this week is a major opportunity to forge stronger economic ties with India in line with core U.S. values to build a more peaceful and open world. Biden should seize it.

On top of this, the recent policy interventions made in terms of a temporal wheat export ban accompanied later with restrictions of exports for sugar is going to adversely impact India’s reputation as a credible exporter and trade partner to other countries along with the US. India can raise its applied rates to bound rates without violating its commitments under the WTO, causing uncertainty for US exporters - as it did for certain telecommunications goods previously.

Steel and Aluminium Tariffs and Retaliatory Tariffs: India has opposed the continued US ""Section 232” steel and aluminium tariffs, applied since 2018. India then applied retaliatory tariffs against the United States after losing its GSP eligibility and these higher tariffs of 10% to 25% affect about USD 1.2 billion of US exports (as per 2020 data), such as for nuts, apples, chemicals and steel. The two sides have been challenging each other’s tariffs in the WTO. Moving forward, both nations will need a more cooperative bilateral trade-tariff structure to work together.

Digital Services Tax (DST): In November 2021, the US announced a “political agreement” with India on its DST treatment. In exchange for India’s commitment to transition from its DST to a newly-concluded, related global tax framework, the US agreed to terminate additional, already suspended duties on certain goods from India. The duties arose from a US “Section 301” investigation, prompted by concerns that India’s DST was unfair to US firms. This is still an area where both countries would need to take domestic steps to implement the global tax framework.

Services: The two nations are competitive in some service industries. India supplies a large exodus of skilled workers from areas of technology, medical care, etc. to the US. The barriers to market access by US firms include India’s limits on foreign ownership and local presence requirements. A key issue for India is US temporary visa policies, which affect Indian nationals working in the United States. India continues to seek a “totalisation agreement” to coordinate social security protection for workers who split their careers between the two countries. An agreement to ensure easier “skilled worker” mobility between India and US would go a long way in developing a stronger trade in services compact. It would also help increase private remittances to India, which helps improve India’s overall Balance of Payments position.

Agriculture: Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) barriers in India limit US agricultural exports. The United States questions the scientific and risk-based justifications of such barriers. Each side also sees the others agricultural support programs as market-distorting; India’s view of its programs from a broad food security lens complicates matters. At the TPF, the two sides agreed to work to finalise market access for a number of products, including for Indian mango exports to the United States and US pork exports to India.

Intellectual Property (IP): The two sides differ on how to protect IP to support innovation and other policy goals, such as access to medicine. Some stakeholders welcomed moves by India to its intellectual property rights (IPR) regime, but they have been disappointed by the pace of reform. India remained on the Priority Watch List of the US 2021 “Special 301” report, which cited such U.S. concerns as India’s patent treatment, high IP theft rates, and lax trade secret protection."

Modi left for his US visit on Tuesday morning. A roadmap for defence industrial cooperation, bettering trade and investment relations, besides forging closer ties in the technology domain comprising telecom, space and manufacturing are some of the key discussions that are likely to take place during PM Modi's state visit to the US.

China's top diplomat Wang Yi, in an opinion piece in The Global Times, pointed that while increasing economic and trade interaction with India, the US has also introduced many geopolitical calculations which is ""doomed to fail"".

This is Modi's sixth visit to the US since taking over as prime minister in 2014 but his first state visit to the US. ""As the US seems to ramp up efforts to push India to confront China and harass China's economic progress, the Financial Times recently warned that Washington's embrace of Modi carries a price, saying the US' charm campaign has been noted with dismay by some of India's elites. They concern that the US attempts to ""use India as a bulwark"" against China,"" the editorial piece read.

Wang Yi, China's former Foreign Minister, said, ""The US' geopolitical calculations are not difficult to read. As feared by many Indian elites, Washington's vigorous efforts to strengthen economic and trade cooperation with India is primarily to slow down China's economic development. However, this geopolitical calculation of the US is doomed to fail, because China's position in the global supply chain cannot be replaced by India or other economies.”

The piece further said despite increased investments in India by American companies, those “such as Apple, are now inseparable from China's supply chain”. It further read that while India seems to offer great market potential, but the country's weaknesses in business environment and industrial supply chain viability remain major hurdles.

“In fact, India's trade with the US cannot replace its trade with China, nor can India replace China in global supply chains. The more India exports to the US, the more it needs to import from China,” the piece said.

""If the US and India want to further develop economic and trade cooperation, they should solve the problems between themselves, rather than targeting China,"" it read.

Saying that the “US pays lip service to India but seldom delivers”, the editorial piece urged India “to abandon geopolitical calculation, such as considering joining the US' reckless and selfish game to contain China”, adding that promoting trade and economic cooperation with China “is of great importance for India's future growth and development”.

Earlier on Tuesday, PM Modi said the aim of his visit will be to deepen India-US ties in key sectors like trade, commerce, innovation, technology and other such areas.

According to Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra, a roadmap for defence industrial cooperation is expected to be the key outcome of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States beginning June 21, PTI reported.

PM Modi, during his first state visit to the US, will also hold discussions with President Joe Biden on bettering trade and investment relations, besides forging closer ties in the technology domain comprising telecom, space and manufacturing.

Anubhav Gupta, Assistant Director, Asia Society Policy Institute

Modi's visit couldn’t come at a more opportune time. President Trump badly needs both an opportunity to bolster his presidency and a clear achievement to add to his win column. In India, Trump has a natural partner, and in Modi, he has a leader he can truly work with.

Modi recently completed a very successful trip to Europe, visiting Spain, France, Germany, and Russia. His visit garnered positive press as he showcased an India that was open for business, ready to take on greater global responsibilities and embrace its European partners. Trump and Modi have an opportunity to craft a similarly lauded and productive visit.

Trump and Modi will use this first visit to build trust and get to know one another. They can begin on the right foot by communicating their desire to advance the relationship to new heights. Modi, who has steadily moved India closer to the United States in his three years in office, is well positioned to take the relationship further after consolidating political power in India through big victories in recent state elections in India. He is strongly situated to win re-election in 2019, and, therefore, shape India’s path over the coming years. The United States should take advantage of his good standing.

The visit’s success will depend on whether the Trump Administration has been able to focus enough of its attention on India to decide whether and how it will seek an upgrade in the relationship. It will also depend on whether the White House can reassure India about some of its major concerns.

Modi is sure to bring up South Asian stability, particularly U.S. policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan. The administration’s recent decision to let the Defense Department determine troop levels in Afghanistan could result in a short-term influx of U.S. troops there, which India might welcome. However, India will look for reassurance that the administration is committed for the long term in Afghanistan and has a true interest in and strategy for maintaining stability. Modi will also push the administration for a more stern U.S. policy toward Pakistan, which continues to support militancy in Afghanistan and India. Support on these two fronts would reassure India greatly.

The two leaders should ensure that legitimate disagreements on certain issues, including worker visas and intellectual property rights, do not hold the relationship back. There is strong bi-partisan support in the U.S. Congress for a closer partnership with India. India’s fast-growing and increasingly more open economy are huge opportunities for the United States. Additionally, Delhi can serve as a vital partner for Washington in the Asia-Pacific region. For all of these reasons, pursuing stronger ties with India would be a clear win for the Trump administration.

Some areas of cooperation are clear. The countries should continue building on their defense relationship and should seek ways to enhance counterterrorism cooperation, especially as this is a major focus for the Trump administration. On the strategic front, the United States should encourage India to enhance its engagement in the Asia-Pacific. Trump can help facilitate this by telling Modi that the U.S. will finally support India’s membership for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Finally, the two leaders can commit to strengthening economic ties by agreeing to a genuine dialogue on enhancing trade or negotiating a bilateral investment treaty.

Security and Defense Are Bright Spots for India-U.S. Relationship

Lindsey Ford, Director of Asian Security, Asia Society Policy Institute

The Trump/Modi meeting will be an important one for both nations and a chance to establish a positive rapport between leaders of two of the world’s largest democracies. Prime Minister Modi, for his part, will likely have learned several lessons in observing Japanese Prime Minister Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visits to Mar-a-Lago earlier this year. He will, therefore, want to position himself as a strong and pragmatic leader, one with whom Trump can do business. Given the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s Asia policy, and in particular, U.S. strategy in South Asia, Modi will also want to remind President Trump of the significance of the U.S.-India strategic partnership and of the U.S. commitment to long-term stability in Afghanistan.

While Trump and Modi may have challenging waters to navigate on the economic front, especially regarding trade deficits and visa issues, a bright spot in their conversation is likely to be the security and defense relationship. The most notable deliverable likely to emerge from the visit is the announcement of the U.S. decision to sell India 22 unmanned Guardian drones, a request which had been at the top of Prime Minister Modi’s wish list. If approved, India will become the first non-NATO country permitted to purchase the high-tech drones. This deal, combined with Lockheed Martin’s recent announcement of a new joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems, signifies the rapid growth of U.S.-India defense ties over the past decade. Perhaps most importantly for the White House, and Prime Minister Modi, it will provide the president with a high dollar figure deliverable — the estimated value of the deal is around $2-3 billion — which would undoubtedly help set a positive tone on both sides and smooth the path for closer cooperation going forward.

India Is the Indispensable Country for Addressing Climate Change

Jackson Ewing, Director of Asian Sustainability, Asia Society Policy Institute

India embodies the core climate debate about how much emerging economies should rely on fossil fuels for their development needs, and few — if any — things are more important for addressing climate change than India’s energy future. India is the world’s fastest growing major economy and fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter. Its emissions grew by roughly 67 percent between 1990 and 2012, and under a business-as-usual scenario would likely climb 85 percent higher by 2030. It also has relatively little culpability for the current climate dilemma compared to its large country peers, accounting for only one-eighth of U.S. and China’s combined cumulative emissions since 1850. India's pronounced development deficits both reflect and stem from its low emissions per capita of about two tons of CO2 equivalent, compared to 20 tons and eight tons in the U.S. and China, respectively. Facing these deficits requires expanding access to energy across the subcontinent, and how India pursues this task will help make or break international efforts to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

India will aggressively transition away from fossil fuels only if doing so makes strategic and economic sense to the country’s political and economic leadership. There are promising signs. India is ambitiously bringing solar and wind power online, funded in part by President Modi’s doubling of a coal tax. India Power Minister Piyush Goyal has called for hundreds of billions in clean energy investment, increased the previous government’s 2022 solar power generation target five-fold, and seeks to double wind power by that same year. Government actions support the view that it sees clean energy is an opportunity space.

Nonetheless, the continuing lure of available coal, major transmission and infrastructure issues, and graft and inefficiency in power and transportation sectors ensure that even best-case scenarios see India emissions that are likely decades from peaking. Accelerating its transition to a cleaner energy future — as Modi makes clear at every opportunity — will require substantial international support. It remains to be seen if such support is in the offing."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's State Visit to the US will have ""significant outcomes"", External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday.

Interacting with reporters on the sidelines of a function here, he also said that it will be the first time that an Indian prime minister will be addressing the US Congress twice.

Prime Minister Modi is visiting the US from June 21-24 at the invitation of President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. They will host Modi at a State Dinner on June 22. The visit also includes an address to the Joint Session of the Congress on June 22.

""The prime minister is going on a State Visit, which signifies the highest level of honour. So, the honour that he will receive, has been accorded to a very few people, so far,"" Jaishankar said after the function that was held at Badarpur in South Delhi as part of the BJP's mega outreach campaign -- 'Sampark se Samarthan' -- to mark the completion of the nine years of the Modi government. ""The prime minister will address a Joint Session of the US Congress. No Indian prime minister has addressed it twice. So, it will be the first time. World over also, very few people have done that... Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela. So, there are very few people who have addressed the US Congress twice,"" Jaishankar said.

It assumes ""huge importance"" and outcomes will be seen later, the external affairs minister said. Asked about the implications of the State Visit on India-US relations, he said this State Visit will have ""significant outcomes"" and added that ""what outcomes these will be, I cannot tell that right now"".

Prime Minister Modi will arrive in New York on June 20 and will lead the 9th International Yoga Day celebrations at the UN headquarters on June 21. He will then travel to Washington DC where he will be welcomed by President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden on June 22 for the State Visit.

Asked what message will this State Visit by Modi to the US send to China and Pakistan, the Union minister said, ""When a prime minister visits a country, it is to take our (India's) relationship forward. I understand that it is a globalised world, so if something happens, it may or may not have an impact on others. We see it for our interests, from perspective of our relations""."

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was once shunned by the United States. Denied a visa for “severe violations of religious freedom,” he was effectively banned from entering the country for nearly a decade.

But in the nine years since that ban was lifted, Modi has been progressively embraced by the White House – now more than ever.

The leader of the world’s most populous nation will meet with US President Joe Biden during a state visit to Washington this week, in a trip that is expected to further boost defense, trade and technology ties, and celebrate “the warm bonds of family and friendship” that link the two countries together.

Modi will also lead celebrations for the International Day of Yoga at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Wednesday, illustrating the influence of India’s soft power.

He will then address Congress the following day, an honor reserved for close US allies, and attend a lavish state dinner hosted by Biden in a clear indication of how much of a strategic partner Modi has become.

But while the ceremonies and diplomatic niceties play out in Washington, analysts say Modi’s visit will also be a test for the Biden administration, that has positioned itself as a democratic protector in an increasingly populist and polarized era, while seemingly turning a blind eye to New Delhi’s alleged human rights abuses playing out at home.

Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has come under scrutiny from rights groups and opposition lawmakers for its increasingly strident brand of Hindu nationalist politics and an ongoing crackdown on dissent. Pressure is growing for Biden, who views India as a critical regional partner, to address those concerns in some way during Modi’s visit.

But analysts say criticism is unlikely given India’s growing leverage in the Indo-Pacfic, as well as its 5 million strong diaspora in the US – among the country’s largest immigrant groups and its fastest growing voting bloc.

Daniel S. Markey, senior adviser, South Asia, for the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), said Washington sees India as “a strategic swing state in a world order increasingly defined by competition between the US and China,” adding that human rights concerns have “generally taken a back seat” to geopolitics.

“But I believe they are still relevant, or should be,” Markey said. “If only because India’s deteriorating democracy will on balance make it a more challenging and less effective US partner.”

“The visit is a test because Biden should not look to be embracing Modi’s authoritarian policies,” he added.

“The goal for the White House, in my view, should be to embrace relations with India without personalizing the relationship or endorsing Modi’s politics. That is a tough needle to thread.”

A challenge for Washington

Modi’s US trip is the latest in a slew of diplomatic engagements he has undertaken in recent weeks, and Washington is not the only Western nation to have rolled out the red carpet.

Last month, he met Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Sydney, who eulogized Modi as a rockstar, called the leader a “boss” and spoke of how he had strengthened Australia’s democracy.

Before that, Modi was in Papua New Guinea, where he met with Prime Minister James Marape and pledged his support for the Pacific Islands, a region that China has also increased outreach to.

Days earlier, he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Japan – the first time they had come face-to-face since Russia’s invasion began.

Markey said this is symbolic of how Modi has prioritized “winning accolades from other democratic leaders in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.”

Such engagements “serve Modi’s political purposes in India,” he added.

“His supporters are encouraged by the respect he wins on the world stage, while his critics are demoralized because their concerns aren’t taken seriously in other democracies,” Markey said.

Last week, Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged the White House to put rights concerns at “the center” of the Modi-Biden summit.

“Modi and Biden should jointly acknowledge human rights challenges – both in India and the US – and agree to address them,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for the group, in a statement.

HRW and Amnesty International have invited policymakers to a screening of the BBC documentary that questioned Modi’s leadership during deadly sectarian riots in 2002 in Gujarat, when he was chief minister of the western Indian state.

The documentary was banned in India and the BBC’s offices in New Delhi were raided by tax authorities soon after it aired sparking outrage among rights groups.

Washington’s comparative silence on criticism of Modi does not go unnoticed within India among government critics and those uncomfortable with BJP rule.

“What irks a lot of people in India is the dishonesty towards Indian democratic norms, religious freedom, and of freedom of press,” said Sushant Singh, a senior fellow with one of India’s leading think tanks, Centre for Policy Research.

“The fact that the White House goes out of its way to call India ‘mother of democracy’… does irk people in India because they believe that the United States has been dishonest.”

A careful maneuver

In Washington this week, Modi and Biden are expected to announce a number of trade and defense deals.

The visit, according to Tanvi Madan, a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, is “significant” and “can’t be seen in isolation.”

It builds on “almost two and a half decades of progress in the relationship,” she said. “There are moments of opportunity that open that have the potential to move relationships to a higher level, and this is one of them.”

Shared concerns over China is a key priority.

India and China have been engaged in a military standoff along their shared Himalayan border that has claimed dozens of lives over the last three years, and both New Delhi and Washington are becoming increasingly uneasy over Beijing’s growing military might, its aggressive territorial claims on land and at sea, and its growing economic influence over its smaller neighbors.

But as India grows closer to the US, it still remains heavily dependent on Russia for its military equipment. That has been a key source of frustration for Western powers.

Rather than cutting economic ties with the Kremlin, India has undermined Western sanctions by ramping up purchases of Russian oil, coal and fertilizer – giving President Vladimir Putin a vital financial lifeline as his forces wage a brutal war against Ukraine that has reverberated across the globe.

New Delhi has also repeatedly abstained from votes condemning Russia at the United Nations – providing Moscow with a veneer of international legitimacy.

This careful maneuvering exemplifies India’s unique position on the war: verbally distancing itself from Russia, while continuing to maintain pivotal relations with Moscow and deepening its ties with the West.

And the West, according to Madan, is willing to go easy on New Delhi because of its growing clout.

“The US has seen India as important in its own right – as a large, economically growing democracy, with military and technological capabilities that will play a key role in the international order,” she said, adding it is also a vital “geopolitical counterbalance, economic alternative, and democratic contrast to China.”

In recent months, signs of problems have also emerged between New Delhi and Moscow. In March, the Indian Air Force said Russia was unable to honor its arms delivery commitments to India because of the war in Ukraine.

On Monday, India’s Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra called New Delhi’s defense relationship with Washington “robust and dynamic.”

Speaking to reporters, he said the defense roadmap that India and the US have been discussing “focuses on all aspects of defense, core production and core development,” and could be a “key aspect” of Modi’s trip.

Meanwhile, Biden’s government is looking to encourage manufacturers to reduce its reliance on China, and pivot towards India, which has 1.4 billion people – many of whom are young, educated and largely English-speaking.

“Modi is being welcomed in various countries because India is seen as an attractive – and useful – partner by many countries because of its growing global and regional role,” Madan said.

“I don’t expect public condemnation from the White House,” she added. “The focus will be a celebration of India and the India-US partnership.”"

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

The White House will roll out the red carpet this week for a crucial Asian ally. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet President Biden on Thursday, with a lavish state dinner also on the schedule. That same day, Modi will address a joint session of Congress. The Biden administration has made deepening ties with India a top foreign policy priority as it hopes to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Seema Sirohi is a columnist for The Economic Times, one of India's most influential newspapers, and author of the book ""Friends With Benefits: The India-U.S. Story."" She joins us now to discuss the trip. Welcome.

SEEMA SIROHI: Nice to be with you.

RASCOE: The White House is pulling out all the stops for Prime Minister Modi. Why is this relationship so important to the U.S.?

SIROHI: Well, the U.S. has identified China as a competitor, as a rival. So India has become very important for U.S.'s Indo-Pacific policy because the U.S. wants to retain its No. 1 position in the region. India, which has China on its border, is in a very sort of border standoff situation for the past two years. So the interests of both India and the United States have converged on countering China, to put it very simply. And then there are many, many other reasons why the U.S. thinks of India as a major partner. India needs the U.S. for its own development. The U.S. needs the talent from India. As you might know, there are almost 200,000 Indian students in the United States, and Indian Americans are increasingly very, very important, both politically as well as in the economic arena.

RASCOE: And so what will Prime Minister Modi want from President Biden during this visit? Like, what are his priorities?

SIROHI: So for India, technology transfer is a top priority. Becoming part of the supply chains is another very big priority. Both countries trust each other, and they are building what they call resilient supply chains so that the world will not be dependent on just one factory that is China. There is a deal that might be signed for one of the major U.S. companies to invest in trying to create a semiconductor ecosystem in India. Another big deal that is likely to be announced is for the U.S. General Electric to co-produce its military jet engines in India. And that's a huge step forward 'cause India has long wanted technology transfer. In the past things have stalled because the U.S. hasn't been so amenable to that.

RASCOE: And so, I mean, you've been covering this relationship for decades, so how has it changed over the years?

SIROHI: What I can tell you is when I first came to Washington, India was not an important partner for the United States. Everything was about China and Pakistan, both of which are rivals of India. Then President George W. Bush changed dramatically the U.S. policy towards India because Bush's idea was why aren't the two democracies better friends? So India and the U.S. signed a major nuclear deal under which India was recognized de facto as a nuclear weapons power. Now people are comparing that transformative moment to today.

RASCOE: Prime Minister Modi has been accused of eroding Indian democracy and suppressing criticism of his ruling party. Do you think any of that will be raised this week?

SIROHI: It won't be raised in public, I would say - not by the administration, not at the White House. But you might see some comments from congressmen and senators on Capitol Hill. But right now, realism in terms of geopolitics tops human rights concerns, to put it very bluntly. Countering China is very important for the United States at this moment, and getting as many allies and partners in line on the American side is the main goal.

RASCOE: That's Seema Sirohi, a newspaper columnist and author of ""Friends With Benefits: The India-U.S. Story."" Thank you so much for being with us.

SIROHI: Thank you.

The dinner with the Fortune 500 CEOs is scheduled, and so is the one-on-one with president Obama.

Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, will be welcomed in New York on Wednesday with much goodwill – but also increasing doubts about his ability to deliver promised reforms in the emerging south Asian power.



If attention in the White House, on Capitol Hill and in the US media is directed elsewhere – to the Middle East, the visits of the Chinese premier, Xi Jinping, and the Pope – the focus of the media in India is not. Modi’s second visit to the US while in office is already generating frontpage headlines and leading bulletins.

For between meetings in New York, Modi, who has been in power for nearly 18 months, will tour Silicon Valley, meet the aristocracy of internet entrepreneurs and address a colourful, noisy rally for members of the Indian diaspora. It is the first visit of an Indian prime minister to the west coast for more than three decades.

More than 40,000 people have applied for 18,500 places at an event in San José, in the heart of Silicon Valley, on Sunday evening.

Organisers hope to repeat the success of the rally in New York on Modi’s first visit to the US last autumn.

“Madison Square Garden was filled with the euphoria following the [May 2014 Indian] election. We are filling the arena with what he has done in a year in office,” said Rakhi Israni, of the Indo-American Community on the West Coast, an umbrella organisation of 500 groups, which is behind the event.

There are 2.8 million Indian Americans, forming one of the wealthiest and best-educated diaspora communities in the US. Many became involved in Modi’s election campaign and levels of support for the prime minister, who leads the Bharatiya Janata party, have long been high.

Around half a million Indian Americans, the second biggest concentration in the US, live in the San Francisco Bay area and the community is overrepresented in the IT industry.

According to research conducted in 2012 by Stanford University, Indian Americans have founded more technology companies than any other immigrant group.

For Modi, the west coast community of Indian Americans is significant both politically and economically.

Advisers say the prime minister, who has consistently promoted technology as the answer to India’s enduring social and economic problems, believes there is an opportunity to enlist the most powerful people in the global IT industry in his push for technological modernisation in his homeland.

Modi will visit Facebook’s Menlo Park headquarters, Googleplex in Santa Clara, and Tesla, the clean energy firm.

Along with IT superstars like Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Tim Cook of Apple , the vegetarian yoga practitioner will also be seeing Sundar Pichai and Shantanu Narayen and Satya Nadella, the India-born heads of Google, Adobe and Microsoft.

Though India’s IT industry has long been lauded as one of the country’s success stories, the broader challenges of developing the internet around the country remain substantial.

Though there are said to be more than 300 million internet subscribers in India – more than fifth of the population – most connections are patchy and among the slowest in the world. Only a tiny fraction qualify as broadband by industry definitions. A complex web of conflicting commercial interests and bureaucratic obstacles has hindered rapid improvement. Even telephone calls drop repeatedly and are often barely audible, while network congestion means it is impossible to use a smartphone even in parts of the capital, Delhi.

The slow progress at clearing such problems – typical of those that have so far put the brakes Modi’s modernisation drive in other fields – has meant the investment some hoped would come following the landslide election last year has not yet materialised.

“Modi is trying to convince innovators and investors in the US that India is an easier place to invest in but there’s a growing perception that he is all talk and no action on reform. When he was made prime minister, there was tremendous excitement in the [US] community but expectations have not been met, ” said Michael Kugelman, south Asia specialist at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington.

Last week, Jeff Immelt, the CEO of General Electric, told reporters he saw great opportunities in India but wanted it to “be easier to do business” there.

“We believe that ... Modi’s vision is the right vision and what we expect is just execution – better execution, more execution, faster execution,” Immelt said.

Economic growth in India has recovered to around 7% after flagging before Modi took power.

Commentators point out that trade between US and China was six times greater than that with India last year.

Arms sales from the US to India have soared however, with a $2.5bn deal to buy helicopters cleared by Indian officials earlier this week. The US has now overtaken Russia as India’s biggest arms supplier. There are also ambitious plans for cooperation in the field of sustainable energy.

The US and India have many common interests and are both known for their “democracy, diversity and talent for entrepreneurship and innovation”, former and current Indian diplomats say. India is seeking investment while the US is looking to open new markets. Both nations are concerned about China’s influence and growth.

However, relations have never been smooth and there are mutual accusations of trade protectionism.

Senior officials in Delhi, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of India’s recent positions, such as temporarily blocking a global trade deal last year, simply reflected as “newly confident and robust” response after decades of “punching below our weight”.

During the cold war, India tilted towards Moscow, and the US towards its hostile neighbour Pakistan. In 2005 Modi was denied a visa to the US under a law barring entry to foreigners who have committed “particularly severe violations of religious freedom”.

The decision followed accusations that Modi, who started his career as an organiser with a rightwing Hindu organisation, had stood by during, or even encouraged, sectarian violence in the western state of Gujarat in 2002, when he was chief minister there. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed by rioters.

Modi has denied all wrongdoing and India’s supreme court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to back the charges against him.

The relationship reached a nadir when the Indian deputy consul-general in the US was arrested for visa fraud in New York in December 2013. The affair prompted a vitriolic reaction in India to what was seen as disrespectful bullying. This in turn prompted US commentators to accuse India of oversensitivity and behaviour unbecoming of an aspirant future power.

Since then, however, there has been some improvement. A visit by Obama in January, even if cut short by the death of king Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, was seen in India as a turning point – although the president’s short lecture on women’s rights and diversity was less well received.

However, Kugelman said India was still unlikely to receive sustained attention from US policymakers.

“The last meeting between Obama and Modi injected a lot of momentum into the relationship but that does not mean India is on the front-burner in the grand scheme of things,” he said.

Both nations look to the Indian diaspora in the US to bridge deep cultural and ideological differences.

The welcome from Indian Americans is not unanimous, however.

More than 100 US-based academics, most of Indian origin, signed an open letter accusing Modi of presiding over “well-publicised episodes of censorship and harassment of those critical of his policies, bans and restrictions on NGOs leading to a constriction of the space of civic engagement, ongoing violations of religious freedom, and a steady impingement on the independence of the judiciary”.



Such criticism is unlikely to have much impact either at home, where polls say Modi remains very popular, nor in the US. A counter-petition accused signatories of crossing the line between “hitting out at Modi and hurting India”.

Israni, of the Indo-American Community of the West Coast, said the organisers of the San José event this Sunday were “focused on the positive”.

“The idea that he is going to fill up the arena is a testament to the idea that no matter how afar from India they are, home is always home, and there are a lot of people who want to see India progress,” she said."

Last fall in Houston, both leaders put on a show for a raucous crowd of 50,000. They clasped hands before the multitude, and lavished praise on each other. Their encore performance in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, India, later this month will be worth the price of admission, with crowds as outsize as the ambitions of the two headliners.

President Trump’s inaugural visit to India comes after two decades of effort by administrations of both major political parties in both countries to shape a partnership between the world’s largest and oldest democracies. The relationship was born of a shared sense of values, a shared economic stake in India’s modernization, a shared (if usually unspoken) concern about China’s rise, and a shared realization that Americans and Indians need to work together to tackle big, overarching challenges like climate change and transnational terrorism.

Samanth Subramanian: Indian democracy is fighting back

Yet beneath the public displays of affection and tangible signs of progress lie a pair of crucial questions: Will the strategic bet that America and India have made on each other deliver on its full potential? Or will the turn to narrow, transactional diplomacy and the corrosion of democratic ideals in both societies reduce the return on investment? The answers will have enormous consequences for both countries, the future of the Indo-Pacific, and the geopolitics of the century unfolding before us.

For decades, India’s nuclear program, which stood outside the Treaty on Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and beyond the reach of international safeguards, proved an immovable practical and symbolic roadblock to closer relations with the United States.

President George W. Bush made a historic decision in his second term to cut through this most difficult knot in our relationship. Recognizing India’s enormous potential as a long-term partner in a region that was destined to become the global center of gravity in the 21st century, Bush believed that bringing India in from the nuclear cold would be a net plus for American strategy. If New Delhi agreed to abide by key nuclear safeguards and commitments, the United States would lean on the international community to bend nonproliferation rules and accept India’s nuclear program.

I was the diplomat charged with completing the U.S.-India civil-nuclear deal in the summer and fall of 2008. Selling the agreement in international forums was mostly an exercise in blunt-force diplomacy, with little of the practiced finesse that so often consumes the profession. I have sheepish memories of waking senior European officials in the middle of the night to obtain an exception for India from the Nuclear Suppliers Group. I didn’t belabor the technical arguments, nor did I really try to do much convincing. This was about power, and we were exercising it—hardly endearing ourselves to groggy partners, but impressing our Indian counterparts with the strength of America’s commitment to get this done.

Read: ‘Howdy, Modi!’ was a display of Indian Americans’ political power

The whole initiative was not an easy call—not for foreign capitals and not for the U.S. Congress. Questions remained about just how aligned India would be with us, how significant the costs of the India exception would be to nuclear diplomacy and the broader nuclear-nonproliferation regime, and whether the economic benefits for the American nuclear industry would ever live up to the hype. Proponents of the civil-nuclear deal tended to overstate the promise and understate the risk. Critics did the opposite, and were then lambasted by Indian officials as “nuclear ayatollahs” whose nonproliferation zeal blinded them to wider possibilities. Bush’s decision, nevertheless, was bold and smart.

Barack Obama agreed and was equally invested in what he called “a defining partnership for the 21st century.” And while it proved impossible to replicate the dramatic breakthrough of the nuclear deal, and while rhetoric on both sides often outstripped delivery, we made steady progress, especially in military cooperation, riding the momentum of ever-more convergent interests and values.

That momentum accelerated when Modi was first elected prime minister, in the spring of 2014. He embraced a more confident role for India on the world stage and the revitalization of its domestic modernization—convinced that a deepening partnership with the United States would serve those twin goals.

I was the first senior American official to visit Modi in New Delhi, shortly after his inauguration. Modi acknowledged his complicated history with the U.S. (he was denied a visa for a decade over concerns about his involvement in anti-Muslim violence when he was chief minister in Gujarat), but he was looking forward, self-assured about his leadership of India and the possibilities of U.S-India relations. He and Obama developed a cordial rapport. Security cooperation grew impressively; trade and investment, not so much. A rising China underscored the quiet logic of partnership between Washington and New Delhi.

Although “quiet logic” is not his forte on any issue, President Trump has continued the American investment in relations with India, significantly broadened defense partnership, and even rebranded the Obama-era rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region with a new “Indo-Pacific” strategy. His pugnacious approach to trade and immigration issues irritates Indians, but has not interrupted the broadly positive arc of the relationship.

Trump and Modi have gradually developed their own rapport, superficially similar in their grasp of political branding and strongman habits. Both are skilled in the business of political showmanship, with a keen eye for the vulnerabilities of established elites, and for the dark art of stoking nativist fires.

Beneath those surface similarities, however, they are very different people, leading two very different societies. Modi grew up in modest economic circumstances, helping his father sell tea on a railway platform in Gujarat. Trump was a child of economic privilege, his early business career propelled by his father’s wealth and connections. Modi rose through the ranks of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the wellspring of India’s Hindu majoritarian ethos, and later its political arm, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), developing an insider’s ideological convictions. Trump stormed the Republican Party from the outside, less attached to political principle or ideology than to the rawer politics of grievance and resentment.

In their impact on their own societies, and on the future direction of U.S.-Indian partnership, Trump and Modi are raising some disquieting questions. After a resounding reelection last spring, Modi has struggled with India’s most severe economic slowdown in three decades. Lacking a compelling strategy for the economy, he has doubled down on the one set of issues for which the BJP has a very clear and unified vision: Hindu majoritarianism. With coercive force and scant regard for constitutional limits, Modi’s government has put its Hindu chauvinism on full display.

Soon after his reelection, Modi revoked the constitutionally protected autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, and its top political leadership remains under house arrest more than six months later. His government has pushed a new citizenship law that discriminates against Muslims seeking refuge in India, and has fed tensions over disputed religious sites. Pressures against critical journalists and academics have increased. The BJP has run into political difficulties in state and local elections, but its national opposition, the Congress Party, is a shell of its former self, and the courts and civil society are on the defensive. The political turmoil has only added to India’s economic difficulties—and put a strain on the country’s relationship with the U.S.

Read: The dueling narratives of India’s Kashmir crackdown

A battle for the idea of India is under way, between the tolerant constitutional convictions of its founders and the harsher Hindu majoritarianism that has lurked beneath the surface. This tension predates Modi and will outlive his leadership, testing India’s democratic guardrails in much the same way that the Trump era is testing America’s. Neither struggle will be settled by outsiders—but both will shape the nature of Indian-American partnership in the years ahead.

Both leaders will no doubt accentuate the positives during Trump’s visit. Increasing defense and intelligence cooperation is an asset for both countries. Some nominal progress on persistent problems in trade and market access is likely, but without the structural transformations that neither side has the will or attention span to accomplish right now. Both Trump and Modi will laud each other’s leadership, and the health of the partnership under their watch.

The deeper issue, however, is what kind of relationship we are building.

As intolerance and division in both societies erode their democracies, I fear that the leaders may reinforce each other’s worst instincts. Trump’s fixation on the capillaries of trade balances may only enable Modi to avoid arterial reforms, and the president’s erratic unilateralism will only feed Indian wariness about his judgment on the most consequential regional dilemmas, such as Afghanistan and China’s growing assertiveness.

I continue to believe strongly in the wisdom of the strategic investment that America and India have made in each other’s success over the past two decades. However, amid the spectacle of the visit, it’s important to remind ourselves that the relationship is bigger than these two leaders. For India and the U.S. to maximize the return on their investments, we must take a long view, keeping in mind why this strategic bet was made in the first place: our common democratic values, a long-term vision of economic openness, and a growing confidence in each other’s reliability.

Right now, both Washington and New Delhi, in their own ways, are part of the problem in a world where democracies are busy undoing themselves, economic nationalism is unbridled, and geopolitical competition is unbounded by rules or predictability. The sooner both countries recommit themselves, and their partnership, to being part of the solution, the better."

By Aman Sinha: There is a visible anticipation and excitement in echelons of Washington DC regarding Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the USA as my American Lawyer colleague told me over a cup of coffee that Modi’s visit will be “awesome” for India-US partnership and also for global common good!

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's State visit to the USA is a celebration of partnership between two biggest democracies of the world, a triumph of shared values and an affirmation of the biggest economic and strategic partnership of the century.

Understandably, USA has accorded the highest diplomatic status to visit of Prime Minister Modi by designating this as a State visit which is a rare honour accorded to a few State leaders. Even rarer is the fact that Narendra Modi will be first Prime Minister of India to address the US Congress for the second time an honour which only three other world leaders have been bestowed upon till now.

The enthusiasm and excitement in Indian diaspora is unprecedented as thousands of Indian-Americans joined unity March in more than twenty top cities of USA over this weekend to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi and express their admiration for new found status of India as the emerging global leader due to transformational changes ushered in PM Modi’s leadership which has made India the fastest growing global economy.

PM Modi’s visit will lay the foundation for one of the biggest economic and strategic partnerships of the century that will have a significant global impact. This partnership has to be seen specifically in the context that the bilateral goods and services trade between India and USA has almost doubled since 2014, exceeding 200 billion USD and today USA is the biggest trading partner of India.

There is palpable admiration in American society and International community in general that and even amidst covid pandemic, crumbling global economies and international turmoil India has emerged as the brightest spot in the global economy and the engine of global economic growth by consistently performing as the fastest growing global economy. The journey of Indian economy from fragile five in 2014 to the top five global economies has been swift and in the leadership of PM Modi India is soon expected to become the third biggest global economy.

The prowess of the Indian economy can be gauged from the fact that all the leading international investors and analysts are optimistic about India’s growth trajectory. The Economist said has stated that India would comfortably attain the target of becoming a five trillion economy and our spending on infrastructure is already twice that of the western world. International Monetary Fund(IMF) sees India as a bright spot in the global economy. The World Bank says that India is in a better position to deal with global headwinds than many other countries. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has said that India will be among the fastest-growing economies in the G-20 group this year. According to Morgan Stanley, India is moving towards becoming the world’s third largest economy in the next 4-5 years. The CEO of McKinsey has said that this is not only India’s decade but India’s century. Institutions and credible voices that track the global economy have unprecedented confidence in India and that has gone a long way in strengthening the India-US relationship.

The Indian economy has prospered and at the same time in the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the whole world is one family) even amidst the Covid pandemic, India was not only addressing the domestic Covid situation but helping internationally through vaccine maître project reflecting the true Indian spirit. India has already exported more than 180 million vaccines to around 100 countries and UN agencies to support the global fight back against the pandemic. There is immense admiration for this Indian spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam in American society and a few US lawmakers in their interactions with me also heartily appreciated this Indian spirit. When Covid-19 struck the world, India and the US were two Countries which went out of their way to help the global community during this pandemic crisis. This is a true reflection of the fact how India has emerged as the force of global good as aptly stated by Prime Minster Modi himself a few weeks back.

There is wide acknowledgement of the fact the primary reason for surging Indian economy and India becoming growth engine for the world is the way PM Modi has been able to reform, perform and transform through his policy measures and legal reforms. Prime Minister Modi on his own initiative has got 1500 laws repealed and 40,000 compliances junked. This has not only greatly enhanced the ease of doing business but ease of living for Indians. This is one of the biggest transformational legal and economic reforms of contemporary times. No other country in the world would have repealed and abolished so many redundant laws and compliances as India has done in a span of only nine years. In additional new progressive laws conducive to enhancing the ease of living and ease of business have been enacted.

India rising to the fifth biggest global economy and fastest growing economy firmly on track to be third big global economy has happened not by coincidence it’s a result of structural, institutional, reforms and the decisive and visionary leadership of PM Narendra Modi. PM Modi has addressed the fundamental problems of Indian economy and Indian society which were languishing for a long time and today every citizen has electricity, clean water, healthcare, gas, housing, food and bank account which has unleashed the potential and aspirations of each and every Indian citizen. This has led to an organic and structural growth of Indian economy and Indian society and now we are seeing a multiplier effect of all these far sighted visionary measures undertaken by PM Modi and this momentum is going to stay as India becomes the third biggest economy in the world in next 3 years.

There are several areas with immense potential where mutually beneficial partnerships could be considered such as in defense and industrial cooperation that co-develops and co-produces important defense capabilities. Strategic Technology Partnership on critical emerging technologies in defence, space semiconductors, advanced telecommunications biotechnology, emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence to name a few. The issue of increase in number of visas to Indian students and professionals may also be considered.

Under the visionary leadership of PM Modi, India has not only become an economic power but has also become the ‘Most Reliable Country’ in the world. More importantly, it is a country with whom you can not only do business but can have a sustainable friendship based on the civilizational values that consider this world to be part of one larger family where countries join hands to meet the global challenges.PM Modi’s visit to US is also much anticipated in this context.

India and the US are natural partners. India US relationship has become a successful and enduring relationship which has withstood the test of time and regime changes in the USA. It is the profound and charismatic leadership of PM Narendra Modi which has made this relationship prosper at an unparalleled pace irrespective of regime changes in the USA. And it seems that the strong bond between India-US will become a global game changer after this visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the United States of America."

“India is currently the fifth largest economy and it’s only moving up in the ranks,” says Abrahms, associate professor of political science at Northeastern University. “This trip was an enormous deal for India, because it really signified its arrival as a major geopolitical power in a way that we’ve never seen before.”

Modi arrived in Washington, D.C., last Wednesday for a four-day state visit. His schedule was packed with meetings with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and other state officials, a state dinner at the White House in his honor, an address to the U.S. Congress and meetings with chief executive officers of major American companies among other commitments.

He also met with a small group of think tankers to discuss a range of developmental and geo-political issues, according to Modi’s official website. Abrahms was one of the participants of that meeting.

Abrahms received an invitation to meet Modi from India’s ambassador to the U.S. He believes he was chosen because of his expertise on political violence and terrorism. India is very concerned with counterterrorism, Abrahms says, particularly, with radical Sunni terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Abrahms has also participated several times at an annual international conference on geopolitics and geoeconomics in New Delhi—the Raisina dialogue—that attracts some of the most important people in the policy world, he says, including heads of state, foreign ministers and high-ranking military officials.

The structure of the meeting was very informal, according to Abrahms. The guests were not coached in advance about what they could or could not ask Modi.

Seated in a “modest circle,” each participant had an opportunity to address the prime minister or ask a question, and he responded to everyone individually through an interpreter.

As the only representative of academia, Abrahms told Modi that India is having a very noticeable effect on higher education in the U.S.

“I said that perhaps India’s greatest resource is its human talent,” Abrahms says. “I can attest that some of my very best students are from India, and one of my main co-authors is from India.”

Abrahms talked about the interface between human talent and higher education, he says.

The difficult question of human rights violations in India did come up during the meeting as well, and Modi emphasized that he values democracy, Abrahms says, and that it’s a really important basis for the India-U.S. relationship, both currently and moving forward.

Modi’s visit to the U.S. was met with mixed reactions, including criticism, protests and a boycott of his address in Congress by a few lawmakers. Modi was banned from visiting America for almost a decade, from 2005 to 2014.

The State Department denied Modi a diplomatic U.S. visa based on “severe violations of religious freedom” during deadly sectarian riots between Hindu and Muslim residents in 2002 in Gujarat, a western Indian state, where he was chief minister at the time.

This trip was an enormous deal for India, because it really signified its arrival as a major geopolitical power. Max Abrahms, associate professor of political science at Northeastern University

Although Modi visited the U.S. several times since he became prime minister in 2014, this was the first official state visit with a red carpet and a state dinner.

Abrahms says there are several possible reasons why Modi is receiving a much different treatment now. One has to do with the rise of China.

“Increasingly, there’s concern among American officials that China will contest the United States as a hegemonic power, including in the Pacific,” he says.

India has a complicated relationship with China. It purchases more goods from China than from any other country, Abrahms says. The two countries, however, also have outstanding and sometimes active territorial disputes.

“So, the hope from American officials is that increasingly we can move India into the American sphere essentially, that if there is a war with China, India can be counted on as an ally,” Abrahms says.

A lot of concrete objectives of the trip, he says, aimed at enhancing defense ties between India and the U.S. India has purchased expensive drones and is teaming up with General Electric to develop engines for Indian fighter jets.

“India is already in what’s called ‘the quad,’ which is made up of the United States, India, Japan and Australia,” Abrahms says, “and to a large extent, the goal is to contain China.”

Another goal is to move India away from Russia and wean it off Russian weapons. The war in Ukraine reinforces the perception that U.S. weapons are superior to Russian, Abrahms says.

India has been heavily criticized for not taking a stronger stance on the war in Ukraine and maintaining trade relations with Russia.

“Prime Minister Modi says that he is pro-peace, and I share that view,” Abrahms says. “A lot of sort of hotheads in the West, who want regime change and Moscow and I don’t really partake in that kind of advocacy.”

India is hesitant about getting overly involved in great power competition, he says, to avoid going to war with either Russia or China, while maintaining strong relations with the West.

A large part of Modi’s visit was also focused on increasing business ties, taking into account that India is presumed to become the third largest economy in the world.

However, Abrahms believes, there was another domestic political component to Biden reaching out and welcoming Modi so visibly. Indian Americans constitute one of the biggest minority groups in the U.S.

“They tend to exercise their vote disproportionately more than some other groups,” Abrahms says, meaning the upcoming 2024 presidential election.

President Biden used a state visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday to publicly defend India’s democratic values while doubling down on his criticism of China, praising an Indian leader who has been widely accused of overseeing a series of repressive moves in his country. Keeping up with politics is easy with The 5-Minute Fix Newsletter, in your inbox weekdays. ArrowRight Asked about allegations by human rights groups that Modi’s government has cracked down on dissent and targeted religious minorities, Biden drew a sharp contrast between India and China, whose leader he recently characterized as a dictator.

“One of the fundamental reasons that I believe the U.S.-China relationship is not in a space as it is with the U.S.-India relationship is that there’s an overwhelming respect for each other because we’re both democracies,” Biden said. “And it’s a common democratic character of both our countries and our people — our diversity; our culture; our open, tolerant, robust debate.”

Modi, addressing reporters alongside Biden, seized on the president’s comment that democracy is in the “DNA” of both America and India, saying that in his country’s values, “there’s absolutely no discrimination, neither on basis of caste, creed, or age, or any kind of geographic location.”

Biden declined to soften his description earlier this week of Chinese leader Xi Jinping as a dictator, saying he would not be “avoiding what I think is the facts” about the U.S.-China relationship. Dismissing what he called “hysteria” about tensions between Washington and Beijing, Biden said he plans to meet with Xi soon and that he did not think his comment “had any real consequence.”

Most human rights groups view China as a repressive authoritarian state, while India is seen as a flawed democracy whose leaders are making increasingly troubling moves. The United States urgently wants India as an ally against China, and Biden’s decision to lavish praise on Modi reflects the complexities behind his frequent depiction of a worldwide struggle between democracy and autocracy.

White House aides said Biden’s high-level engagement with Modi during the state visit — a mixture of intricate pageantry and substantive agreements on technology, diplomacy and defense — reflected India’s increasingly prominent role in global affairs and Washington’s desire to boost ties with the world’s most populous nation.

Modi is seeking to bolster his country’s global standing, which White House officials say could in turn benefit U.S. interests. Modi joined Biden for a meeting in the Oval Office, addressed a joint meeting of Congress and attended a state dinner. He is scheduled to have lunch with Vice President Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday.

In his address to Congress, Modi appeared to bolster Biden’s view of China without mentioning the country by name, saying that “the dark shadows of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo-Pacific.”

In contrast, he did not condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as U.S. officials want him to, saying only, “I now say directly and publicly: This is not an era of war, but it is one of dialogue and democracy. And we all must do what we can to stop the bloodshed and human suffering.”

Modi’s trip to Washington was just the third official state visit of Biden’s presidency, following similar honors for French President Emmanuel Macron and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. Modi, who also addressed U.S. lawmakers in 2016, is one of only a handful of world leaders who have been invited twice to address a joint meeting of Congress.

Modi repeatedly referred to India as a robust democracy during his speech, seemingly an implicit response to the criticism.

“Being a citizen of a vibrant democracy myself, I can admit one thing: Mr. Speaker, you have a tough job,” Modi said, turning to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). “I can relate to the battles of passion, persuasion and policy. I can understand the debate of ideas and ideology. But I’m delighted to see you come together today to celebrate the bond between the world’s two great democracies — India and the United States.”

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle rose repeatedly to applaud, while visitors in the House gallery chanted, “Modi! Modi!” Earlier, during a raucous arrival ceremony with thousands of chanting supporters, Biden hailed Modi and touted the “limitless possibilities” of the U.S.-India relationship.

“Two great nations, two great friends, two great powers that can define the course of the 21st century,” Biden said.

Biden and Modi announced several agreements, including a deal to jointly produce a GE fighter jet engine in India and efforts to shore up supply chains for microchips and other key technologies. They also announced that the United States will open new consulates in Bangalore and Ahmedabad, while India will open a new consulate in Seattle.

The comparison between India and China arose in part because of an informal comment Biden made earlier this week about Xi.

Speaking at a fundraiser in California, Biden made what appeared to be an off-the-cuff comment about America’s downing in February of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon, suggesting that Xi had been kept in the dark about it by his own government. “That’s what’s a great embarrassment for dictators — when they didn’t know what happened,” Biden said.

China reacted angrily to that characterization of its leader, calling it “extremely absurd and irresponsible,” but the White House has not backed away from it.

On Thursday, Modi spoke to a Congress that now includes five Indian Americans, while a vice president of Indian descent sat behind him, creating a striking tableau that Modi did not fail to note. “There are millions here who have roots in India, some of them sitting probably in this chamber — and there is one behind me, too,” Modi said. “I’m told the samosa caucus is now the flavor of the House. I hope it grows and brings the full diversity of Indian cuisine here.”

While Biden told reporters that he had discussed human rights and democracy in his private meeting with Modi — saying the United States and India both face “challenges” on those fronts — he did not publicly address the concerns of human rights groups, lawmakers and others who called on the president to take a more aggressive stance.

The organization Human Rights Watch, for example, says that Indian authorities “prosecute activists, journalists, peaceful protesters, and other critics on fabricated counterterrorism and hate speech laws.” Modi’s government, it adds, “has adopted laws and policies that discriminate against religious minorities, especially Muslims.”

Activists also cite a proliferation of bigoted rhetoric and attacks on freedom of speech since Modi’s rise to power in 2014, which they say has emboldened Hindu-nationalist groups to act with impunity. The U.S. State Department has also highlighted these developments in reports and statements, saying the situation has grown worse in recent years.

Modi denied that anti-democratic trends are widespread in India and said he was surprised that critics were even raising these issues, given his country’s democratic character. India, he said, has proved that “democracy can deliver,” adding, “when I say deliver, this is regardless of caste, creed, religion, gender.”

Before Modi’s arrival, more than 70 members of Congress urged Biden to use the meeting with the prime minister to address political violence, internet shutdowns, restrictions on press freedom and other “troubling signs” in the world’s largest democracy.

“As longtime supporters of a strong U.S.-India relationship, we also believe that friends can and should discuss their differences in an honest and forthright way,” the lawmakers wrote. “That is why we respectfully request that — in addition to the many areas of shared interests between India and the U.S. — you also raise directly with Prime Minister Modi areas of concern.”

Some lawmakers, including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), both Muslims, boycotted Modi’s speech to Congress.

A small crowd of demonstrators protested Modi’s visit near the Capitol on Thursday, some holding signs that read, “Religious freedom: All lives in India matter” and “U.S. supporting killer Modi.”

“He’s trying to transform India into a Hindu nation,” said Sheena Sood, 38, who traveled from Philadelphia. “I’m here because we have to resist whenever there is an authoritarian leader who has a fascist’s agenda but claims it’s a secular democracy.”

Daniel Markey, a senior adviser at the U.S. Institute of Peace and a former State Department official, said it’s important for Washington to cultivate closer ties to India, but he criticized former president Donald Trump — and now Biden — for lavishing praise on Modi personally.

“It was bad enough with a Trump administration that didn’t seem to care at all about democratic values, but there’s now an even deeper dissonance with a Biden administration that has said democracy should be at the core of how it makes foreign policy,” Markey said.

Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, said that Biden always brings up human rights and democracy in meetings with foreign leaders and that this visit would be no different. At the same time, he said, there is limited value in the United States trying to lecture Modi on the importance of democratic principles.

“As countries, as societies, as polities, my personal view is the best way to do that is to have candid, robust discussion not just between our governments, but between our civil societies, between our activists, between our journalists,” Sullivan said.

In the lead-up to the visit, U.S. officials had lobbied the Modi government to agree to participate in the joint news conference, something the Indian leader has not done in years, officials said. On Wednesday, the White House announced that Modi and Biden would indeed take questions from reporters.

But it was hardly a freewheeling give-and-take. Only two reporters, one from the U.S. press corps and one from the Indian press corps, were allowed to ask questions of the leaders.

Eager to entice Modi, the Biden administration went to extraordinary lengths to convey an exaggerated sense of India’s strategic importance. Their apparent courtship of Modi is driven by a desperate desire to establish a tangible alliance aimed at countering China’s growing influence on the global stage, while simultaneously driving a wedge between New Delhi and Moscow. Through lavish ceremonies and diplomatic pleasantries, Washington left no stone unturned in its portrayal of India as an “indispensable friend” in today’s geopolitical landscape. With a raft of agreements and deals, spanning from defense, semiconductors, space, telecommunications, critical minerals and core technologies, Modi’s visit is perhaps one of the most important foreign policy venture in India’s recent history.

“The dark clouds of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo-Pacific. The stability of the region has become one of the central concerns of our partnership” said Modi in his “euphoric” address to the Congress yesterday. But, caught in the whirlwind of Washington’s excessive “generosity and hospitality,” PM Modi must not succumb to the allure of these calculated romantic overtures of Washington, which are destined to disrupt the delicate balance the Indo-Pacific, posing economic and political complications for all stakeholders. The strategic intent of the Biden administration towards Modi’s visit is twofold: firstly, to forge a robust tapestry of interconnected defense, technological, and trade alliances with India, thereby presenting a tangible counterweight to China’s ever-expanding clout in the Asia-Pacific sphere. Secondly, the administration aims to sow seeds of uncertainty and estrangement in the longstanding relationship between Russia and India.

However, the Biden administration’s pursuit of these objectives is fraught with complexities and potential pitfalls. The intricate web of challenges and potential obstacles that lie ahead for the American strategy of enticing India are too big. Beyond the symbolism and ceremonial gestures, the Biden administration has a strategic interest in drawing India closer within its manufacturing and defense sphere, a move that is targeted at reduction in New Delhi’s dependence on Russian military equipment but also to facilitate the diversification of US supply chains away from China. During the Trump era, the United States generously granted India Strategic Trade Authorization Tier 1 (STA-1) status. This strategic move effectively facilitated the export of cutting-edge high technology products from US companies to their Indian counterparts. Under the Biden Administration, this high technology partnership has further deepened. Among them, the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology, jointly spearheaded by the national security advisors of both nations, is of strategic nature. Additionally, the reinvigoration of the US-India Strategic Trade Dialogue, focusing on the controlled export of dual-use items, further underscores the mutual commitment to robust cooperation in the realm of advanced technology. Ironically, the majority of US policy makers think that if New Delhi were to weaken its ties with Moscow, it would inadvertently strengthen the bond between two “adversarial” powers – China and Russia – and this scenario would inversely lead to India’s inordinate reliance on the United States. But this will compel Modi to divert resources from developmental priorities to defense expenditures – certainly it will have a negative impact on the Indian economy. These hawks in the Biden administration, though frustrated over India’s oil purchases from Russia and its precarious balancing act on the Ukraine war, believe that India is the most viable option to counter China in the Indo-Pacific. For precisely this very reason, Modi’s visit has been granted a distinct and exceptional treatment by the Biden administration.

Over the past decade, the United States and India have witnessed a visible transformation in their relationship, characterized by numerous avenues of engagement. The strategic dialogues between the two nations encompass a range of initiatives, such as the Quad (involving Japan and Australia), I2U2 (including Israel and the United Arab Emirates), the 2+2 Dialogue featuring defense and foreign ministers, the Defense Policy Group (DPG), and the aforementioned Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET) Initiative. Furthermore, there exist numerous forums for trade policy, commercial dialogue, economic and financial partnership, strategic trade, and CEO interaction, like the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership, Higher Education Dialogue, and India’s participation in three of the four pillars of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).

The China factor is perhaps the most compelling component of the existing love affair between Washington and New Delhi. In its National Security Strategy document released in last October, the Biden administration expressed its strategic intent toward India in these words: “As India is the world’s largest democracy and a major defense partner, the United States and India will work together, bilaterally and multilaterally, to support our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.” PM Modi’s visit to Washington is a crucial component of the strategic vision outlined in the NSS. Modi’s glitzy state visit will certainly enhance his standing in domestic politics. However, it also exposes a significant foreign policy conundrum: how to manage the delicate balancing act between cozying up to Washington while navigating reservations and estrangements from Beijing and Moscow, with whom India maintains vital economic and military dependencies. Modi finds himself grappling with the complexities of aligning with the United States while ensuring that India’s relationships with other key players remain intact. This predicament highlights the challenges of maintaining a nuanced foreign policy, where the pursuit of one alliance may strain ties with others. The state visit serves as a stark reminder of the intricate web of dependencies India must deftly negotiate, walking a tightrope between competing interests and the potential consequences. The ultimate challenge lies in striking a delicate equilibrium that safeguards India’s strategic autonomy while advancing its economic and political interests.

The visit will put on full display the ""deep and close partnership"" between the U.S. and India, the White House said, despite concerns India's democratic principles have eroded under Modi's leadership.

The relationship has been described by Biden as ""one of the most important"" of this century as the U.S. rebalances its foreign policy focus to the Indo-Pacific in the face of an increasingly aggressive China. Just ahead of Modi's visit, President Biden suggested Chinese President Xi Jinping was a ""dictator.""

""There's a strategic imperative in the region,"" Tanvi Madan, the director of The India Project at the Brookings Institution, told ABC News. ""Multiple administrations have seen India as a geopolitical counterbalance, an economic alternative and a democratic contrast to China.""

The two leaders greeted each other warmly on the South Lawn in a welcome featuring marching bands and honor guards, despite rainy weather. Vice President Kamala Harris, the first person of Indian descent in her role, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were also there to greet the prime minister.

""The challenges and opportunities facing the world in this century require that India and the United States work and lead together, and we are,"" Biden said.

Modi said the partnership between the U.S. and India ""will be instrumental in enhancing the strength of the whole world.""

Biden and Modi met in the Oval Office and appeared side by side at a brief news conference in the East Room, a rarity for Modi who only held his first-ever press conference in India in 2019 after being in power for five years.

Modi also appeared on Capitol Hill to address a joint meeting of Congress before a state dinner at the White House Thursday night.

The prime minister received a standing ovation as he entered the chamber to chants of ""Modi, Modi"" from members, though a handful of progressive Democrats boycotted the speech, citing reports of human rights abuses.

Modi took a moment to note those in the chamber who have Indian roots, turning to point to Vice President Harris seated behind him whom he celebrated as having ""made history.""

""We come from different circumstances and history, but we are united by a common vision. And, by a common destiny,"" Modi told lawmakers in closing. ""When our partnership progresses, economic resilience increases, innovation grows, science flourishes, knowledge advances, humanity benefits, our seas and skies are safer, democracy will shine brighter and the world will be a better place.""

About 400 guests are expected to attend the dinner, the White House said, which will include a plant-based menu and a mixture of American and Indian decor. There will be performances from American violinist Joshua Bell and from Penn Masala, a South Asian a cappella group from the University of Pennsylvania.

Modi's trip to Washington, though, isn't without controversy as the prime minister's been criticized for a rise in violence against religious minorities as well as a crackdown on the press and dissenters.

Some democracy watchdogs have downgraded India's rating in recent years. The U.S.-based Freedom House rated India as ""partly free"" in its 2023 report, and the Sweden-based Varieties of Democracy called India an ""electoral autocracy.""

""He's got a mixed record,"" Richard Rossow, chair U.S.-India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said of Modi. ""We do see at times he feels politically weak domestically, he's initiated steps that directly or indirectly seem to stoke the fears of religious intolerance by him and his party. And we've also seen crackdown on civil society to some extent.""

Human rights advocates and at least 70 lawmakers called on Biden to directly address human rights violations during Modi's visit. Experts told ABC News any human rights or democratic issues will likely be taken up in private between the two leaders.

Biden was asked during the news conference about those who've criticized his administration as overlooking such human rights concerns in hosting Modi.

""Look, the prime minister and I had a good discussion about democratic values,"" Biden responded. That's the nature of our relationship, we're straightforward with each other and we respect each other.""

""I believe that we believe in the dignity of every citizen and it is in America's and I believe in India's DNA that the whole world, the whole world has a stake in our success,"" the president continued. ""Both of us, in maintaining our democracies, make us appealing partners and enables us to expand democratic institutions across, around the world.""

Modi, meanwhile, sidestepped a question on recent allegations of human right abuses as he claimed in India ""there's absolutely no discrimination, neither on basis of cast, creed, or age, or any kind of geographic location.""

""I'm actually really surprised that people say so,"" the prime minister said as he defended his government. ""Indeed, India is a democracy ... democracy is in our DNA. democracy is our spirit. democracy runs in our veins. We live democracy.""

Also at issue during the trip was Russia. India, which has long relied on Russian oil and weapons, has avoided outrightly condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

But experts noted Modi's slight change in tone when it comes to Russia's invasion, such as his recent statements on the importance of territorial integrity and sovereignty.

""Both Washington and New Delhi understand that they will not necessarily see eye to eye on Russia,"" Kenneth Juster, who served as the U.S. ambassador to India during the Trump administration, told ABC News. ""But they can discuss that issue candidly with each other, and it is not going to have a negative impact on their broader strategic partnership.""

A senior Biden official said the White House would ""engage actively"" with India on issues related to Russia and Ukraine, specifically India's efforts to diversify away from Russian military equipment.

Talks between Biden and Modi also included trade, climate and space.

The two leaders announced a number of new commitments, including a joint space mission as well as various investments in technology, defense and clean energy.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking to the U.S.-India Business Council last week, touted trade between the two nations reached a record $191 billion. Blinken noted the U.S. is India's largest trading partner, and Indian companies invested more than $40 billion in the U.S. in IT, pharmaceuticals and more.

Though Juster said be believed there is still more work to do to advance on the trade front ahead of the state visit.

""For the world's largest economy, the United States, and its fifth largest economy, India, I believe that their bilateral trade relationship does not fulfill all of its potential. I am hoping that the two countries can continue to advance their trade and investment relationship both bilaterally and regionally, because economic issues are so important in the Indo-Pacific and China has a robust economic strategy for the region,"" he said.

Prior to landing in Washington, Modi met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk as well as other business leaders and health care experts.

He also marked International Day of Yoga by participating in a group session on the lawn of the United Nations headquarters.

The last time Modi visited the U.S. was in 2019, when he appeared alongside former President Donald Trump at a ""Howdy Modi"" rally in Texas attended by tens of thousands of people.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to the United States included yoga at the United Nations, an address to the U.S. Congress that promised strides in the bilateral partnership, and a lavish state dinner at the White House with 400 guests. President Joe Biden spoke of the “unlimited potential” of ties between India and the United States.

What might have been a moment of pride for India, however, was marred by comments made by his ministers and party leaders that only reinforce the lamentable record of the Modi government’s abusive and discriminatory policies at home. A litany of reports, including many by the U.S. government itself, document intensifying attacks, discrimination, and persecution of groups targeted due to their religion, caste, ethnicity and public opinion.

Modi, in his speeches, took pains to preempt or counteract criticisms. He hailed India’s diversity and democratic standards. But actions and statements by members and supporters of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) contradicted those claims with outraged condemnation of Americans — activists, lawmakers, journalists, even former President Barack Obama — who had called for human rights protections in India. The bigotry and intolerance reflected in the backlash highlight a pattern with the BJP that threatens to undermine India’s reputation as the world’s largest democracy.

On the eve of the state visit, U.S. lawmakers sent a letter to President Biden about democratic and human rights backsliding under Modi’s leadership, as did more than 50 civil society groups, mostly from the Indian-American diaspora. Trucks in New York City carried billboard screens about human rights failures tagging Modi as the “#CrimeMinisterOfIndia.” The editorial boards of the New York Times and Washington Post encouraged the U.S. government to distinguish India’s long democratic tradition from the abusive actions of the current government.

Verbal Attacks for Criticism

BJP leaders only reinforced those negative impressions with their acerbic lashing out against two incidents of criticism during Modi’s trip. One comment came from former U.S. President Barack Obama, who in an interview with CNN during Modi’s visit suggested that it was important to talk “honestly” about the Modi government’s failure to protect minorities, which he warned could set off “large internal conflicts.” The other perceived criticism came in the form of mere questions during a standard joint news conference with Biden, which the White House persuaded Modi to join — a rarity for him. Wall Street Journal correspondent Sabrina Siddiqui asked Biden and Modi questions about reports of worsening discrimination against religious minorities in India.

The BJP leadership swiftly attacked Obama and Siddiqui on social media and Indian television, and were soon joined by online trolls known for amplifying such rhetoric. The BJP chief minister in India’s Assam state, in an echo of attacks by former U.S. President Donald Trump, highlighted Obama’s Muslim middle name, Hussein, in a tweet that essentially threatened Indian Muslims with prosecution for criticizing the Modi government, as Obama had.

Modi’s finance and defense ministers also harshly attacked Obama, sidestepping the substance of his remarks and accusing him of hypocrisy.

The Biden administration condemned the BJP’s attacks on Siddiqui, which had caustically flagged her Muslim heritage and her relatives from Pakistan and questioned her agenda and professionalism. “We absolutely condemn any harassment of journalists,” a White House spokesperson said, adding, “It’s completely unacceptable,” and “antithetical to the very principles of democracy that were on display last week during the state visit.”

What Kind of `Voice’ for the Global South?

India’s current and past governments have often sought to give voice to the Global South, where many countries still bear the burden of inequity, injustices, and social rifts — legacies of colonialism or Cold War-era political interference. India can speak with authority about how Western countries now need to address new challenges linked to climate change, food insecurity, and fair access to health, technology, and development.

India should also speak out against human rights abuses in other countries, whether in the United Statesand other close allies, or in Myanmar, China, Sudan, and elsewhere. India, among the world’s largest economies, has become a key trade and security partner to the United States and other economic powers, and is increasingly prominent in global affairs.

But India’s actions and statements on the world stage will never be convincing if the Indian government doesn’t demonstrate a willingness to allow scrutiny of its own record, while truly committing to the “shared values” that Modi and Biden enthusiastically celebrated. India will have little credibility on issues of human rights or social justice if the Modi government and the BJP continue to follow the path of divisiveness and brittle defensiveness.

The BJP needs to stop attacking messengers and instead start addressing India’s worsening human rights situation. Modi, not only as prime minister but as a leader of the BJP, needs to stop accommodating purveyors of hate and condemn their toxic attacks. His government should ensure that authorities, including in state governments where his party is in power, investigate and prosecute those responsible for inciting or carrying out violence against minorities. Indian authorities should immediately drop politically motivated cases against political opponents, journalists, and civil society critics.

Modi has described India as the “Mother of Democracy.” But the slogan can have no meaning unless he uses the power of his office and his immense personal popularity to ensure the government genuinely upholds democratic principles, including equality, pluralism, and basic freedoms of speech and thought."
158,https://scroll.in/article/1051464/modi-in-washington-us-media-highlights-democracy-debate-indian-media-focuses-on-pageantry,"Modi in Washington: US media highlights democracy debate, Indian media focuses on pageantry",,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to the United States this week was covered by news media from both countries with a contrast.

Beyond the usual reporting on bilateral agreements being signed, the American news media generally focused on the alleged democratic backsliding in India under the Modi government and its possible impact on Delhi and Washington’s bilateral relations.

However, in contrast, most of the Indian media largely focused on the pageantry during Modi’s visit.

American media coverage

The state visit, considered the United States’ highest expression of bilateral relations with any country, assumed significance because both the United States and India now have a common rival: China.

Even before Modi embarked on this state visit, American news media had published opinions and expert commentary about the alleged attack on human rights in India under Modi. This, they highlighted, had led to a tricky situation for Biden who has projected the two nations’ shared democratic values as the basis for their bilateral relationship.

During Modi’s visit, the United States’ news organisations extended their focus to the business aspects of Modi’s visit to highlight Delhi’s utility for Washington as a geopolitical counterweight to China. On Thursday, for example, American news media widely reported on the military drone procurement and the fighter jet engine production deal between the two countries.

However, the United States’ media organisations such as The Washington Post also continued to report on how Modi’s visit was putting Biden’s “democracy-vs-autocracy pitch” under pressure. Some other outlets similarly reported how Biden was emphasising on Delhi and Washington’s common interest areas and “publicly skirting points of friction” such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and “crackdown on human rights” in India to ensure the visit’s success.

Additionally, as compared to their Indian counterparts, the American news media reported more prominently about half a dozen United States’ lawmakers boycotting Modi’s address to the joint session of the United States Congress, the country’s federal legislature. The boycott was to protest what they allege is Modi’s poor human rights record, particularly toward minorities in India.

Some American news outlets such as NBC News also reported how Modi’s visit had highlighted the “deep divide” within the United States’ Indian diaspora over the allegedly poor human rights record of the Modi government. Similarly, on Thursday, The New York Times reported how groups critical of Modi’s treatment of minorities were protesting outside the White House, even as Biden hosted the state dinner inside.

Indian media coverage

However, in contrast, beyond the usual coverage of the bilateral agreements being signed, much of the Indian news media was largely focussed on the pageantry of Modi’s visit. They largely steering clear of reporting on the alleged democratic backsliding in India being a possible hurdle in strengthening of the India-US bilateral ties.

Instead, on Friday, several Indian news websites and pro-Modi government portals reported about how many times Modi had received a standing ovation while addressing the joint session of the United States Congress. It is a long-standing custom for the US Congress’ members to give a standing ovation to whoever addresses the joint session, including foreign leaders.

Similarly, “Modi, Modi” and “Vande Mataram” slogans being raised in the legislature during the Indian prime minister’s address was widely reported.

Additionally, the Indian news media reported extensively about the gifts Modi and Biden exchanged on behalf of the two countries. Similarly, the menu of the state dinner Biden hosted for Modi at the White House on Thursday was the subject of several Indian news stories. However, some American news outlets also reported on the menu.

Moreover, contrary to the United States’ media reporting about different diaspora groups rallying in favour of and against Modi, Indian news media widely reported about groups supporting Modi that had gathered in Washington to welcome him.

Meanwhile, Modi’s response to a question posed by an American journalist on rights of Muslims and other minorities in India, made it to the front pages of Indian newspapers and was widely reported online. Modi was asked the question at a rare press conference with Biden on Thursday. In contrast, Modi taking the question in the press conference was reported prominently by only some United States news organisations such as CNN."

In a letter dated Thursday, the top Democrats and Republicans in each chamber said the speech would provide an opportunity to hear the prime minister's vision for India's future and views on the ""global challenges our countries both face.""

The letter was signed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

“We look forward to paving the way for greater collaboration in the years to come,” the lawmakers wrote.

Modi last addressed a joint meeting of Congress in 2016. The address “left a lasting impact and greatly deepened the friendship between the United States and India,” congressional leaders wrote in their letter.

The Indian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the invitation.

The United States in recent years has sought to strengthen ties with India, the world’s largest democracy, to counter China’s rising influence both regionally and globally. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden announced last month that they will host Modi for an official state visit, including a state dinner at the White House on June 22.

Modi, who has served as India's top elected official since 2014, has been viewed as a controversial figure following deadly 2002 riots in Gujarat when he was chief minister of the Indian state. In 2005, he was denied a visa to the United States over the riots, which killed more than 1,000 people, but India’s Supreme Court last year upheld a ruling that he should be cleared of all charges related to the riots. Modi has denied any wrongdoing.

Modi's visit to the U.S. comes as relations between Washington and New Delhi have grown fractious at times, particularly over the amount of oil India has purchased from Russia, which helps it in its war against Ukraine. India has maintained a neutral stance toward the war in Ukraine.

But the U.S. and India are largely aligned on efforts to address China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region and on climate change.

India and China have had multiple skirmishes along their border in recent years, with the most significant clash taking place in June 2020 when India said 20 of its soldiers were killed."

From the seas to the stars, this partnership will now be deepened by the defining role of technology, the statement said.

From expanding bilateral technology partnership with a focus on tech-sharing and co-production to creating first of its kind platforms on financing renewables and closer industry tie-ups on space, the strategic global tie-ups are aimed at keeping India and the US ‘’as the closest partners in the world’’.

The two countries are committed to the key Indian demand of greater technology sharing, while also ensuring co-development, and co-production opportunities, the statement said.

In fact, the term ‘technology’ was mentioned as many as 44 times in the document. It had found just five mentions the last time both nations released a joint statement, back in February 2020.

“President Biden also reiterated his government’s commitment to work with the US Congress to lower barriers to US exports to India of HPC technology and source code,” it added.

It also announced a new implementation arrangement on artificial intelligence, advanced wireless, and quantum technologies.

The cooperation extended to outer space where the leaders welcomed India’s Space Policy — 2023, and called for enhanced commercial collaboration between the US and Indian private sectors in the entire value chain of the space economy.

The statement also included ‘’addressing current export controls and facilitating technology transfer’’.

In the energy space, both nations announced the setting up of a multi-billion-dollar investment platform for green energy aimed at providing catalytic capital and de-risking support. Another platform aimed at accelerating cooperation in green hydrogen, offshore and onshore wind, and other emerging technologies was also announced.

Securing supply chains

Securing of supply chains has figured significantly during the Prime Minister's visit with both nations reiterating the partnerships and commitments focused on establishing a reliable flow of critical products and technology.

Launch of two joint task forces on advanced telecommunications, focused on Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) and research and development in 5G/6G technologies, also figured prominently in the statement. O-RAN field trials and rollouts, including scaled deployments, in both countries with operators and vendors of both markets, will be backed by US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) financing.

According to the statement, India has joined the global Mineral Security Partnership (MSP). Launched in June last year by the United States, the European Union and other G7 partners, it aims to contain Chinese influence over mining and shipping of critical minerals such as lithium and cobalt, across the world.

Both nations noted the opportunity for deeper collaboration to secure supply chains in defence procurement and pharmaceuticals. ""The Indian Ministry of Defence and the US Department of Defence will commence negotiations for a Security of Supply arrangement and initiate discussions about Reciprocal Defence Procurement agreement,"" the statement said.

As part of the Defence Industrial Roadmap, both countries have agreed to work together for the creation of logistic, repair, and maintenance infrastructure for aircraft and vessels in India. The statement also announced the launch of the India-US Defence Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X), a network of universities, startups, industry and think tanks, with the goal of facilitating joint defence technology innovation.

Greater trade, easier movement

In a significant move, the US and India have decided to mutually resolve six of the seven outstanding bilateral trade disputes at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). ""The leaders welcomed the resolution of six outstanding WTO disputes between the two countries through mutually agreed solutions as well as their understandings on market access related to certain products of significance to the bilateral trade relationship,"" the statement read.

Also, Boeing will invest $100 million on infrastructure and programmes to train pilots in India, supporting the country’s need for 31,000 new pilots over the next 20 years. The leaders welcomed Boeing’s announcement of its completion of a C-17 aftermarket support facility for MRO and a new parts logistics center in India.

Pointing to the US decision to allow domestic renewal of 1-B and L category temporary work visas by next year for Indian nationals, the statement said both sides will open new consulates too. The US will open new facilities in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad, and India in Seattle and two other US cities.

“Prime Minister Modi has presided over a period of rapid deterioration of human rights protections in India, including increasing violence against religious minorities, shrinking civil society space, and the criminalization of dissent. Meanwhile, President Biden’s time in office has been concurrent to a devastating period of backsliding on reproductive rights and increases in vitriolic anti-LGBTQI+ attacks at the state level, all in a political climate informed by structural racism and socio-economic injustice,” said Amanda Klasing, national director of government relations and advocacy at Amnesty International USA.



“These human rights concerns are not fringe issues. They are fundamental in determining how a government operates, who it serves, and who it leaves out. A crucial test of the India-US alliance is whether these two leaders can engage in meaningful discussions about these and other concerning human rights failures of their governments.”

During his first official state visit to the United States, the Indian Prime Minister has been invited to a state dinner along with an address to a Joint Session of the US Congress the week of June 22.

“While the red carpet has been rolled out for Prime Minister Modi, people in India continue to experience grave human rights abuses. India and the US are important partners and allies in various world forums, including the G20 and Quad. As leaders of countries seeking to advance or retain global leadership, Biden and Modi must hold each other to account for their human rights commitments, rather than sweep human rights issues in their respective countries under the rug,” said Aakar Patel, chair of Board at Amnesty International India.

Amnesty International has documented how the Indian government’s criminalization of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly has placed dangerous constraints on civil society. Human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, political opponents, peaceful protesters, academics and students all face arbitrary arrests and detention, unjust prosecutions and other forms of harassment and intimidation.

Financial and investigative agencies of the government have been weaponized to harass, silence, and criminalize independent critical voices, including media organizations such as the BBC and prominent non-governmental organizations including Greenpeace India, Oxfam India, Independent and Public-Spirited Media Foundation (IPSMF), Centre for Policy Research, Amnesty International India and several others

“The Indian Government relies on an ever-growing toolbox of tactics to repress dissent, now targeting those online, censoring activists and journalists, placing them under surveillance. President Biden must call on Prime Minister Modi to end his government’s abuse of laws to target civil society and free speech,” said Aakar Patel. “He should also voice concern about the BJP’s abuse of laws and policies to systematically discriminate against religious minorities.”

Driven by discriminatory nationalist Hindutva ideology, many state governments in India have passed laws to criminalize consensual inter-faith marriages and undertaken punitive demolitions targeting Muslim-owned properties. Victims of such demolitions continue to struggle for compensation and other remedies.

President Biden must call on Prime Minister Modi to end his government’s abuse of laws to target civil society and free speech. Aakar Patel

This targeting of religious minorities in India has been widely documented, including by the US State Department. Earlier this year, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) recommended for the fourth year in a row that India be added to a list of countries perpetuating systemic and egregious violations of the right to freedom of religion, saying that conditions in the country for religious minorities “continued to worsen” throughout 2022. The US State Department 2022 Report on International Religious Freedom reported ‘violence by government authorities against members of religious minorities’.

“President Biden cannot ignore the evidence provided by his own State Department,” said Amanda Klasing. “He must clearly state that the growing intolerance and violence is a great concern of its administration. He should encourage Prime Minister Modi to convey to BJP leaders the urgent need to end vitriolic language and to ensure crimes against religious groups are investigated and prosecuted.”

President Biden cannot ignore the evidence provided by his own State Department. He must clearly state that the growing intolerance and violence (in India) is (of) a great concern (to his) administration. Amanda Klasing

Prime Minister Modi’s visit takes place during a challenging climate for human rights in the US as well. Under President Biden, the US has seen a devastating backslide on access to abortion. Following the June 2022 US Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional guarantee to access abortion, at least 14 states have implemented total or near-total bans on abortion, with dozens more advancing restrictive legislation. The power to fully legalize abortion throughout the country lies with the US Congress however the President has critical authority to support abortion access in the meantime. President Biden has taken some executive action but has the power to do more, including to declare a national health emergency to protect abortion access in the United States.

In view of India’s Supreme Court ruling in 2022 that extend the right to access abortion to all women irrespective of marital status, and the detrimental impact the US Supreme Court’s ruling has had on access to health not just in the United States but also globally, Amnesty International urges Prime Minister Modi to press President Biden to ensure access to abortion to the fullest extent of his authority and to encourage members of Congress, when he meets with them, to pass legislation federally protecting access to abortion.

President Biden must also be prepared to address the threats to human rights here in the US and look to examples from other countries, including India, where constitutional courts have extended human rights protections and legislatures have ratified key human rights treaties. Amanda Klasing

The US has failed to ratify key human rights treaties protecting the rights of children, advancing gender equality, and ensuring access to healthcare. When Prime Minister Modi meets with US Congressional offices, he should further urge Senate leadership to move towards ratification of conventions the US has already signed, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention of the Rights of the Child.

“There are increased threats to sexual and reproductive health and rights and vitriolic attacks on people needing access to a range of healthcare in the US,” Amanda Klasing said. “As President Biden raises human rights threats in India, he must also be prepared to address the threats to human rights here in the US and look to examples from other countries, including India, where constitutional courts have extended human rights protections and legislatures have ratified key human rights treaties.”

“Modi and Biden have the opportunity to take a principled approach to supporting each other in advancing more rights-respecting policies at home,” said Aakar Patel. “With the world watching, their silence will be felt by the people in India and the US whose rights are most at risk of abuse.”"

This was the first in-person meeting between the two leaders during which a range of issues were discussed. These included the concerns about the recent development in Afghanistan, a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, vaccination efforts to control the spread of the Covid pandemic, and ensuring resilient supply chains for critical medicines, therapeutics, and healthcare equipment.

Clean energy transition in the context of climate change was also discussed, acknowledging the importance of collaborative action between India and the US for tackling the issue. PM Modi talked about India’s push for increasing renewable energy and the recently launched National Hydrogen Mission. He also emphasized the importance of lifestyle changes to promote environmental sustainability.

For future India-US collaboration, the meeting focused on areas including space cooperation, Information Technology, emerging and critical technologies, and the healthcare sector. The two leaders also discussed the importance education linkages and the flow of knowledge, innovation, and talent between the two countries.

During the meeting, US Vice President Harris is said to have agreed that India had been a victim of terrorism for several decades and that there was “a need to rein in, and closely monitor, Pakistan’s support for such terrorist groups”. This was Suo Moto referred to by Harris in the meeting. She also asked Pakistan to act so that this will not impact the security of both the US and India.

PM Modi’s Meeting with Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga

Ahead of the upcoming Quad meeting, PM Modi met the Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga, on 23 September 2021. The two leaders discussed ways to take forward India-Japan bilateral ties, through enhanced trade and cultural ties. The two leaders discussed the security situation in Afghanistan, reaffirmed their commitment to a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific. They also discussed ways to enhance bilateral security and defense cooperation, including in defense equipment and technologies, between India and Japan.

Both leaders reaffirmed their support to the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI) between India, Japan, and Australia earlier this year as a collaborative mechanism to enable resilient, diversified, and trustworthy supply chains. PM Modi further underlined the need to develop bilateral partnerships in manufacturing, MSME and skill development. Japanese PM conveyed that Japan is taking steps to operationalize the Specified Skilled workers (SSW) agreement signed earlier this year between the two countries, and that towards this end, Japan would be undertaking skill and language tests in India from early 2022.

The two leaders also discussed the efforts to tackle covid-19 pandemic and underscored the importance of the India-Japan Digital Partnerships, especially in start-ups, in further promoting

a digital collaboration and collaboration in emerging technologies between the two countries. Discussions also took place on climate change issues and green energy transition, and the potential for Japanese collaboration with India’s National Hydrogen Energy Mission. They also discussed the progress of bilateral developmental projects in India’s North-Eastern Region under the India-Japan Act East Forum.

PM Modi’s Meeting with Australian PM Scott Morrison

On the side-lines of the first in-person Quad meeting, hosted by the US President Joe Biden, the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi met his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison, for a bilateral meeting. The leaders discussed a range of issues, including the Indo-Pacific, reviewed the developments in the India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the recent ‘two-plus two’ dialogue, other regional developments, and the upcoming Quad meeting.

• Discussion on the Indo-Pacific: India emphasised on the importance of a free, open, and thriving Indo-Pacific, as the region has been dealing with China’s rising military manoeuvring in the region. The leaders reviewed the ongoing negotiations on a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in the meeting.

• Trade, Climate Change and Bilateral ties: PM Modi welcomed former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott’s visit to India as Morrison’s Special Trade Envoy for India, underlining commitment of both countries in achieving an early harvest announcement on an interim agreement by December 2021. He also stressed on the need to have a broader dialogue on the issue of climate change and protecting the environment. The leaders also discussed measures taken towards clean energy technologies. The leaders also spoke about the ways to improve people-to-people ties between the countries.

The Indian and Australian Prime Ministers were meeting for the first time in-person, since the announcement of the AUKUS (Australia, the UK and the US) security partnership (which is being viewed as an effort to oppose China in the Indo-Pacific, will enable the US and the UK to equip Australia with the technology to develop nuclear-powered submarines). The leaders mutually agreed on the need for India and Australia to collaborate for battling the challenges in the post-pandemic world to improve supply chain resilience among other things.

PM Modi’s Interaction with the CEOs

Prime Minister Modi led one-on-one meetings with CEOs of top US companies, including with Vivek Lall (General Atomics), Shantanu Narayen (Adobe), Mark Widmar (First Solar), Stephen A Schwarzman (Blackstone) and Cristiano E Amon (Qualcomm), to discuss opportunities for investments in India. The meetings are in line with the current government objectives of military modernization, enhancing defence trade, advancements in the Information Technology space, growth in the semiconductor sector, innovation in wireless technology and broadly, boosting foreign investment in India. The discussions were along the following lines:

• Meeting with Vivek Lall, CEO ( General Atomics) – The meeting coincides with India’s ongoing efforts to amplify military modernization through the acquisition of drones and state-of-the art technology. During the one-on-one meeting, Prime Minister Modi and Mr Lall discussed the expansion of ties in the defence sector.

• Meeting with Shantanu Narayen, CEO (Adobe) – Mr Narayan expressed interest in expanding collaborations across the domains of healthcare, R&D and education in addition to giving the children of India access to quality animation and video content.

• Meeting with Mark Widmar, CEO (First Solar) – Mr Widmar expressed interest in utilizing the Production Linked Incentive to produce solar energy components in India and integrate the country into the global solar energy supply chain. The company is currently helping Indian resources reach the renewable energy generation target of 100GW.

• Meeting with Stephen A Schwarzman, CEO (Blackstone) – Mr Schwarzman apprised Prime Minister Modi about the current activities of the firm and emphasised the potential for greater engagement through the National Infrastructure Pipeline and the Asset Monetization Programme.

• Meeting with Cristiano E. Amon, CEO (Qualcomm) – The meeting with semiconductor and wireless technology giant Qualcomm saw Prime Minister Modi congratulating the entity for its work over the years and making the case for partnering with the Indian semiconductor space."

And few big democracies have slid further in the rankings of democratic freedom. But you would not guess it from the rapturous welcome Narendra Modi will receive in Washington next week. India’s prime minister has been afforded the honour of a state visit by President Joe Biden. The Americans hope to strike defence deals. Mr Modi will be one of the few foreign leaders, along with Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Volodymyr Zelensky, to address a joint session of Congress more than once. The praise gushed on Capitol Hill about the partnership makes no mention of Ukraine, democracy or grit in the gears of America’s new best friendship.

As our Asia section explains, the global clout of the South Asian giant is rising fast. Its economy is the world’s fifth biggest. Its 18m-strong diaspora is thriving, from America to the Gulf. And India has become indispensable to America’s effort to assert itself in Asia and deter Chinese aggression. Yet though huge, capitalist, democratic and wary of China, India is also poor, populist and, as our interview with Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, its foreign minister, outlines, dismissive of the vestiges of the post-1945 Western order. The relationship is therefore a test case for the messy alliance of democracies emerging in a multipolar world. Can both sides gain the business and security benefits of co-operation even as they share fewer principles than they may care to admit?

India’s ascent is an uplifting story. One of the fastest-growing economies, its gdp is expected to overtake Japan’s and Germany’s by 2028, even as it treads a novel path towards getting rich. In contrast to East Asia’s Tigers, India’s exports are powered by services, of which it is the world’s seventh-largest vendor. Think not just of call centres but data scientists for Goldman Sachs. Infrastructure has also improved under Mr Modi and his immediate predecessors, and manufacturing may pick up as supply chains diversify from China: Apple assembles 7% of iPhones in India. India’s chief failing is its vast numbers of unskilled, jobless young people. It is trying to help them by pioneering a digital welfare state.

Thanks in part to its diaspora, India’s soft power is world-beating. The bosses of Alphabet, ibm and Microsoft are of Indian descent, as are the heads of three of America’s five top business schools. Reflecting the accomplishment of Indian-Americans, 70% of the wider American public views India favourably, compared with 15% for China.

You might think all this makes America and India natural partners. Certainly, a 25-year effort to develop ties has been unaffected by political changes in either country. India is part of the Quad, a security grouping that includes America, Australia and Japan. In order to augment India’s hard power, America is promoting a series of defence deals, some of which may be signed in Washington next week, to enhance military-technology co-operation. The Biden administration reckons this would be the biggest milestone in the bilateral relationship since the striking, in 2005, of a civil-nuclear co-operation agreement.

Yet the relationship faces two potential sources of friction. First, India’s pro-Western tilt—which became more pronounced after border skirmishes with Chinese troops in 2020—is essentially pragmatic. Ideologically, it is suspicious of Western countries and flatly rejects their claim to global leadership. From Jawaharlal Nehru to Mr Modi, India considers the post-war order to have offered it little more than another bout of domination by other countries. The result of these contradictory impulses is disorientating. India is an American strategic partner that mistrusts the West, is unlikely ever to enter a formal alliance with America and is attached to Russia, which supplies it with arms. It is not clear how much support, if push came to shove, America could expect from India. It wants to bolster its land defences against China, not fight over Taiwan.

The second sticking-point is Mr Modi’s attacks on liberal norms. Under his Hindu nationalist, Islamophobic party, India is increasingly hostile to over 200m of its own people. Lynchings and the dispossession of Christians and Muslims are becoming more common. The press is cowed and the courts are largely pliant. Though India seems sure to remain a democracy—not least because Mr Modi is almost guaranteed re-election next year—it is an illiberal one. The fact that only 60m of its 1.4bn people have formal jobs is a potentially explosive situation in a country prone to rabble-rousing.

Some suggest that America risks repeating its history with China, by showering economic advantages on a rival that ends up turning against it. That seems unlikely. Mutual suspicion of China alone should keep India close. Primly rejecting co-operation with India because its ideology and democracy do not conform to Western ideals would only empower China. It would also show that America has failed to adapt to the multipolar world that lies ahead.

Instead, America and its allies should be realistic about where India’s sympathy lies—with its interests, not theirs—and creative in their efforts to find overlaps between the two. That means layering the relationship with common endeavours. The Biden administration’s efforts to accelerate technology transfer to India seem a promising example. By boosting India’s defence industry, America hopes to wean it off dud Russian weapons and provide an affordable new source of arms for other Asian democracies. Other areas of co-operation could include clean energy and tech, where both seek to avoid relying on China.

An alignment of interests, not principles

America’s foreign policy has always combined realism with idealism. So America must speak out against attacks on democratic norms and human rights, even as it works more closely with India. For its part, India must get used to the idea that, as it grows more powerful, it will face more scrutiny. Discount the expressions of unconditional friendship and brotherhood in Washington next week. To work, the relationship will have to function like a long-term business partnership: India and America may not like everything about it, but think of the huge upside. It may be the most important transaction of the 21st century. ■

165,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/narendra-modi-state-visit-us-white-house-biden-human-rights/,"Biden hosts India's Modi for state visit, navigating critical relationship amid human rights concerns",,"Washington — President Biden emphasized the power of democracies on Thursday as he hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House, boasting of the collaborations between the two nations on ""nearly every human endeavor"" while stressing that universal human rights remain vital to the success of both the U.S. and India.

In a news conference Thursday, Mr. Biden called the relationship between the U.S. and India ""among the most consequential in the world"" and ""stronger, closer and more dynamic than at any time in history."" He underscored how two of the world's most powerful democracies were cooperating on issues such as the climate, health care and space, saying that the U.S-India economic relationship was ""booming.""

But standing alongside Modi, who has come under criticism from human rights advocates, Mr. Biden also emphasized the importance of press and religious freedoms. ""The bottom line is simple,"" he said. ""We want people everywhere to have the opportunity to live in dignity.""

A question about his handling of human rights was the first Modi took from a journalist in a press conference since he became prime minister in 2014. A Wall Street Journal reporter asked Modi what steps he and his government are willing to take to improve the rights of Muslims and other minorities and to uphold free speech.

""When you talk of democracy, if there are no human values and there is no humanity, there are no human rights, then it's not a democracy,"" Modi said, through a translator. ""And that is why when you say democracy and you accept democracy and when we live democracy, then there is absolutely no space for discrimination. ... That is why, in India's democratic values, there is absolutely no discrimination, either on basis of caste, creed, age or any kind of geographic location.""

Mr. Biden and Modi devoted the state visit to launching new partnerships in defense, semiconductor manufacturing and more sectors as they look to strengthen their countries' crucial — albeit complicated — relationship.

Thousands gathered on the White House South Lawn for the welcoming ceremony, listening to performances by violinist Vibha Janakiraman and the a cappella group Penn Masala. As Modi arrived, the crowd — including many members of the Indian diaspora — broke out in a chant of ""Modi, Modi, Modi.""

""All eyes are on the two largest democracies in the world, India and America,"" Modi said as the leaders met in the Oval Office. ""I believe that our strategic partnership is important. I'm confident that working together will be successful.""

At the earlier welcoming ceremony, Mr. Biden said he believes the U.S.-India relationship ""will be one of the defining relationships of the 21st century. Since I've become president, we've continued to build a relationship built on mutual trust, candor and respect.""

But as Mr. Biden fetes Modi, human rights advocates and some U.S. lawmakers are questioning the Democratic president's decision to offer the high honor to a leader whose nine-year tenure over the world's biggest democracy has seen a backslide in political, religious and press freedoms.

Biden administration officials say honoring Modi, the leader of the conservative Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is Diplomacy 101. The U.S.-India relationship will be vital in coming decades as both sides navigate an ascendant China and the enormity of climate change, artificial intelligence, supply chain resilience and other issues.

Still, Mr. Biden said at the start of his Oval Office meeting with Modi that he wanted the partnership to be ""grounded on democracy, human rights, freedom and the rule of law.""

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the president intended to raise his concerns but avoid lecturing the prime minister.

""The question of where politics and the question of democratic institutions go in India is going to be determined within India by Indians,"" Sullivan said. ""It's not going to be determined by the United States."" He said ""our part is to speak out on behalf of universal values.""

Among the announcements made Thursday was an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.

The Biden administration also is coming out with plans to bolster India's semiconductor industry. U.S.-based Micron Technology has agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending $800 million and India financing the rest. U.S.-based Applied Materials is announcing it will launch a new semiconductor center for commercialization and innovation in India, and Lam Research, another semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will start a training program for 60,000 Indian engineers.

On the space front, India will sign on to the Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space exploration cooperation among nations participating in NASA's lunar exploration plans. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station next year.

""We made critical and emerging technologies the pillar of our next generation partnership to ensure these technologies promote and protect our values, remain open, accessible, trusted and secure,"" Mr. Biden added. ""All this matters for America, for India and for the world.""

The State Department will also announce plans to open consulates in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad, while India will reopen its consulate in Seattle.

At the welcoming ceremony, Modi called the Indian diaspora in America — the millions of immigrants and their children from the subcontinent living in the U.S. — ""the real strength"" of the U.S.-India relationship. He said the honor of a formal state visit — the first in the U.S. for India since Barack Obama honored Modi's predecessor, Manmohan Singh, in 2009 — reflected the positive impact Indians are having worldwide.

Modi, the son of a tea seller who rose to be India's premier, also recalled that the first time he visited the White House was three decades ago as a ""common man.""

""I have come here many times but today for the first time, the doors of the White House have been opened for the Indian American community in such large numbers,"" Modi said to an estimated crowd of 7,000.

Modi has faced criticism over legislation amending the country's citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalization for some migrants but excludes Muslims, a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists, and the recent conviction of India's top opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modi's surname.

In 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi's visa to the U.S., citing concerns that, as chief minister of Gujarat, he did not act to stop communal violence during 2002 anti-Muslim riots that left more than 1,000 people dead. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.

A group of more than 70 lawmakers wrote to Mr. Biden this week urging him to raise concerns about the erosion of religious, press and political freedoms during the visit.

""It is an important country to me, and we must call out some of the real issues that are threatening the viability of democracy in all of our countries,"" said Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, who was born in India and helped organize the lawmakers' letter. ""If India continues to backslide, I think it will affect our ability to have a really strong relationship with the country.""

Mr. Biden and Modi have also had differences over Russia's war in Ukraine. India abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and refused to join the global coalition against Russia. Since the start of the war, the Modi government has also dramatically increased its purchase of Russian oil.

White House officials note that there are signs of change in India's relationship with Russia, which has long been New Delhi's biggest defense supplier.

India is moving away from Russian military equipment, looking more to the U.S., Israel, Britain and other nations. Modi recently met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and has spoken out about his worries about the potential use of nuclear weapons by Russia.

State visits typically are reserved for America's closest allies, but they also have been used in the past as a carrot to try to strengthen relationships with countries with which the United States has had complicated relationships.

Modi's busy itinerary on Thursday also included an address to Congress and a lavish White House state dinner.

""There are millions here who have roots in India,"" Modi told the joint meeting of Congress Thursday afternoon. ""Some of them sit proudly in this chamber. And there is one behind me,"" he added, nodding to Vice President Kamala Harris and prompting a standing ovation from Republicans and Democrats alike."

break with its neighbour to the north

It was at the height of the Cold War that Washington surprised the world with diplomatic overtures to Beijing that helped China break with its neighbour to the north , creating a starting point for Beijing’s move into the orbit of a rules-based, market-oriented order led by the United States.

If Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was the moment when the post-Cold War period ended, Washington’s diplomatic engagements with China and India in June 2023 provided the clearest read yet on the geopolitical alignment of our new era.

Global Impact is a weekly curated newsletter featuring a news topic originating in China with a significant macro impact for our newsreaders around the world. Sign up now!

But China has come nearly full circle diplomatically, with its refusal to condemn Russia’s war and President Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow . And in India, we have seen at least a significant shift, underscored by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to Washington – only the third head of state to be received by US President Joe Biden at such an elevated level.

Blame for the deterioration of the US-China relationship depends on whom you ask.

02:35 US President Biden defends calling Chinese leader Xi Jinping a ‘dictator’ US President Biden defends calling Chinese leader Xi Jinping a ‘dictator’

Greater engagement with Taiwanese government officials under both presidents is seen from this viewpoint as the abandonment of a one-China policy that allowed the start of formal diplomatic relations

From the opposing side, many Western analysts blame China for poisoning the bilateral relationship through state subsidies and market-access restrictions when many proponents of engagement with Beijing believed that the opposite would occur after the country joined the WTO.

Recent near misses involving the US and Chinese militaries inflamed tensions further. US military command responsible for the Indo-Pacific , also known as “Indopacom”, publicised footage of a Chinese fighter jet making an “unnecessarily aggressive” manoeuvre against its pilots over the South China Sea.

And about a week later, a Chinese warship carried out what the Pentagon called “an unsafe maritime interaction” when it crossed an American warship’s bow, forcing the US Navy destroyer to take evasive manoeuvres to avoid a collision.

Against this backdrop, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken rescheduled a trip to Beijing last month that he postponed in February in response to the overflight of a Chinese balloon that the US government determined was part of a global surveillance programme.

While no one banked on a breakthrough that would reverse the steady deterioration in bilateral ties, some Chinese analysts held out hope for an improvement in ties. US analysts mostly considered the re-establishment of some predictability in the relationship to be the only possible success

02:03 Blinken and Qin Gang agree to continue talks after ‘constructive’ US-China meeting in Beijing Blinken and Qin Gang agree to continue talks after ‘constructive’ US-China meeting in Beijing

Moreover, Xi’s comment to Blinken that “neither party can shape the other according to its own wishes, let alone deprive the other of its legitimate right to development”, was hardly a projection of warmth.

Just a day after Blinken left Beijing, where the results of his trip were mixed at best from the perspective of those hoping for improved ties, Biden, speaking at a political fundraiser in California, Biden referred to Xi as a “dictator”.

Beijing, not surprisingly, reacted with fury , leaving analysts wondering if all of Blinken’s efforts had been undone.

As if to underscore the shift in a geopolitical landscape dominated by Washington and Beijing, Modi arrived in the US capital as Biden’s disparaging remark continued to reverberate in China.

Confirmation that Modi and Biden discussed challenges that China poses to both their countries during their meeting, the state visit seemed to solidify New Delhi’s increasing openness to engagement with the Western countries that Beijing has been sparring with.

Concerns about Modi’s questionable track record on human rights – an issue that Biden and US congressional leaders use often as pretext for his administration’s hard line against Beijing – made Biden’s reluctance to make the issue prominent during the Indian leader’s visit a further indication of Washington’s determination to bolster ties with New Delhi.

It remains to be seen, however, whether US-China tensions will continue to increase, given that Biden administration officials have suggested that Blinken’s trip will lead to further high-level engagements.

US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman announced on Tuesday that she spoke with China’s newly appointed ambassador to the US, Xie Feng, to follow up on issues discussed during Blinken’s visit to Beijing.

And in separate appearances on Wednesday, Blinken assured an audience at New York’s Council on Foreign Relations that Washington does not seek to “contain” China, and Daniel Kritenbrink, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said that more high-level dialogue should result from his boss’ visit to Beijing.

US secretary of state recounts his recent trip during a speech to Council on Foreign Relations in New York

Yet discussing US export restrictions on China, he asks, ‘how is it in our interest to allow them to get technology that they may turn around and use against us?’

The perception that the US intends to “contain” China “economically and globally” was a “lengthy part of the discussions” when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met this month with his Chinese counterparts in Beijing, he said on Wednesday.

Yet holding back the world’s second-largest economy was counter to US interests, Blinken said at an event in New York by the Council on Foreign Relations, adding that he told his hosts in Beijing that “if you actually look at what’s happening, and what’s happened, the facts belie that assertion”.

Why US push for high-level military talks with China is getting nowhere

While Washington sees better communications with Beijing as key to reducing the risk in potential flashpoints, analysts say Beijing has different priorities

China has cited sanctions on its new defence minister as a reason for turning down talks, but has urged the US to stop ‘provocations’ in sensitive areas

The United States is more concerned than China about the lack of high-level military communications because it believes that is one of the keys to reducing the risk of accidents and misjudgments in potential flashpoints such as the Taiwan Strait, military analysts have said.

Beijing, by contrast, believes that US actions are to blame for recent incidents – such as a close encounter between two warships – but existing communications channels can still prevent things spiralling out of control.

As part of his Indo-Pacific strategy to counter China’s burgeoning clout, US President Joe Biden regularly invites leaders of varied political hues from the strategically vital region to the White House.

This week Biden hosted a state dinner for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , an avowed Hindu nationalist leader who was once denied an American visa for his chequered treatment of Muslim minorities.

Despite his retirement, former Chinese vice-premier Liu He is still being regularly consulted on important financial and economic affairs – particularly on issues related to the United States , as Beijing ponders how to deal with Washington in these areas.

Liu, one of President Xi Jinping’s most trusted confidants, still attends internal meetings on economic affairs and remains highly influential, even though he officially stepped down from all posts after the leadership reshuffle in March, five separate sources told the South China Morning Post.

Antony Blinken’s China trip seen as positive but could put some US allies in ‘precarious position’

Beijing and Washington agreed to hold more high-level talks during US secretary of state’s two-day visit

But relations are ‘still very fragile’ and nations in the region ‘will continue to face pressure to take sides’, analyst says

The US secretary of state’s trip to Beijing this week may have gone some way towards reassuring China’s neighbours over their rivalry, but observers say long-term concerns remain.

Beijing and Washington agreed during Antony Blinken’s two-day visit to hold more high-level talks – the latest effort to halt a downward spiral in relations that has left many nations in a tough position over which side they support. Such exchanges had been largely frozen after the US shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon in February.

TSMC’s US plant the result of industrial policy meant to counter China, giving states like Arizona more economic heft

Arizona’s strength in semiconductors helped it court TSMC, but the deal could not have happened without the implicit promise of federal spending

The state has been ramping up educational pipelines to supply TSMC with everything from entry-level technicians to semiconductor engineers

This is the first of a two-part series looking at how Arizona was chosen as the US state to host the latest semiconductor wafer fabrication plant from TSMC, the world’s leading chip foundry, in a move that is redefining geopolitical boundaries in the global chip industry.

When an Arizona delegation visited Taipei in 2013, the state was hoping to attract some major investment from Taiwan, but the self-ruled island’s chip-making giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) was not the main target. That honour went to Apple supplier Foxconn Technology , formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry.

Madam Vice President,

Distinguished Members of the US Congress,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Namaskar!

It is always a great honour to address the United States Congress. It is an exceptional privilege to do so twice. For this honour, I extend my deepest gratitude on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India. I see that nearly half of you were here in 2016. I feel your warmth as old friends. I can also see the enthusiasm of a new friendship in the other half. I remember Senator Harry Reid, Senator John McCain, Senator Orrin Hatch, Elijah Cummings, Alcee Hastings and others, who I met here in 2016, and who are sadly no longer with us.

Mister Speaker,

Standing here, seven Junes ago, that’s the June when Hamilton swept all the awards, I said that the hesitations of history were behind us. Now, when our era is at a crossroads, I am here to speak about our calling for this century. Through the long and winding road that we have travelled, we have met the test of friendship. A lot has changed since I came here seven summers ago. But a lot has remained the same – like our commitment to deepen the friendship between India and the United States. In the past few years, there have been many advances in AI – Artificial Intelligence. At the same time, there have been even more momentous developments in another AI – America and India.

Mister Speaker and Distinguished Members,

The beauty of democracy is the constant connect with the people, to listen to them, and feel their pulse. And, I know this takes a lot of time, energy, effort, and travel. It is a Thursday afternoon - a fly-out day for some of you. So, I am grateful for your time. I also know how busy you have been this last month.

Being a citizen of a vibrant democracy myself, I can admit one thing Mister Speaker – you have a tough job! I can relate to the battles of passion, persuasion and policy. I can understand the debate of ideas and ideology. But I am delighted to see you come together today, to celebrate the bond between world’s two great democracies - India and the United States. I am happy to help out whenever you need a strong bipartisan consensus. There will be – and there must be - a contest of ideas at home. But, we must also come together as one when we speak for our nation. And, you have shown that you can do it. Congratulations!

Mister Speaker,

The foundation of America was inspired by the vision of a nation of equal people. Throughout your history, you have embraced people from around the world. And, you have made them equal partners in the American dream. There are millions here, who have roots in India. Some of them sit proudly in this chamber. There is one behind me, who has made history! I am told that the Samosa Caucus is now the flavour of the House. I hope it grows and brings the full diversity of Indian cuisine here. Over two centuries, we have inspired each other through the lives of great Americans and Indians. We pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Junior. We also remember many others who worked for liberty, equality and justice. Today, I also wish to pay a heartfelt tribute to one of them – Congressman John Lewis.

Mister Speaker,

Democracy is one of our sacred and shared values. It has evolved over a long time, and taken various forms and systems. Throughout history, however, one thing has been clear.

Democracy is the spirit that supports equality and dignity.

Democracy is the idea that welcomes debate and discourse.

Democracy is the culture that gives wings to thought and expression.

India is blessed to have such values from times immemorial.

In the evolution of the democratic spirit, India is the Mother of Democracy.

Millennia ago, our oldest scriptures said,

‘एकम् सत् विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति’.

It means - the truth is one but the wise express it in different ways.

Now, the US is the oldest and India the largest democracy.

Our partnership augurs well for the future of democracy.

Together, we shall give a better future to the world, and a better world to the future.

Mister Speaker,

Last year, India celebrated 75 years of its independence. Every milestone is important, but this one was special. We celebrated a remarkable journey of over 75 years of freedom, after a thousand years of foreign rule in one form or another. This was not just a celebration of democracy, but also of diversity. Not just of Constitution, but also of its spirit of social empowerment. Not just of our competitive and cooperative federalism, but also of our essential unity and integrity.

We have over two thousand five hundred political parties. Yes, you heard that right- two thousand five hundred. About twenty different parties govern various states of India. We have twenty-two official languages and thousands of dialects, and yet, we speak in one voice. Every hundred miles, our cuisine changes. From Dosa to Aloo Prantha and from Srikhand to Sandesh. We enjoy all of these. We are home to all faiths in the world, and we celebrate all of them. In India, diversity is a natural way of life.

Today, the world wants to know more and more about India. I see that curiosity in this House too. We were honoured to receive over hundred Members of the US Congress in India over the last decade. Everyone wants to understand India’s development, democracy and diversity. Everyone wants to know what India is doing right and how. Among close friends, I am happy to share the same.

Mister Speaker,

When I first visited the US as Prime Minister, India was the tenth largest economy in the world. Today, India is the fifth largest economy. And, India will be the third largest economy soon. We are not only growing bigger but we are also growing faster. When India grows, the whole world grows. After all, we are one sixth of the world’s population! In the last century, when India won its freedom, it inspired many other countries to free themselves from colonial rule. In this century, when India sets benchmarks in growth, it will inspire many other countries to do the same. Our vision is सबका साथ, सबका विकास, सबका विश्वास, सबका प्रयास. It means: Together, for everyone’s growth, with everyone’s trust and everyone’s efforts.

Let me share with you how this vision is translating into action, with speed and scale. We are focusing on infrastructure development. We have given nearly forty million homes to provide shelter to over hundred and fifty million people. That is nearly six times the population of Australia! We run a national health insurance programme that ensures free medical treatment for about five hundred million people. That is greater than the population of South America! We took banking to the unbanked with the world’s largest financial inclusion drive. Nearly five hundred million people benefited.

This is close to the population of North America! We have worked on building Digital India. Today, there are more than eight hundred and fifty million smart phones and internet users in the country. This is more than the population of Europe! We protected our people with two point two billion doses of made in India COVID vaccines, and that too free of cost! I may be running out of continents soon, so I will stop here!

Distinguished members,

The Vedas are one of the world’s oldest scriptures. They are a great treasure of humanity, composed thousands of years ago. Back then, women sages composed many verses in the Vedas. And today, in modern India, women are leading us to a better future. India’s vision is not just of development which benefits women. It is of women-led development, where women lead the journey of progress. A woman has risen from a humble tribal background, to be our Head of State.

Nearly one point five million elected women lead us at various levels and that is of local governments. Today, women serve our country in the Army, Navy and Air Force. India also has the highest percentage of women airline pilots in the world. And, they have also put us on Mars, by leading our Mars Mission. I believe that investing in a girl child lifts up the entire family. Empowering women, transforms the nation.

Mister Speaker,

India is an ancient nation with a youthful population. India is known for its traditions. But the younger generation is also making it a hub of technology. Be it creative reels on Insta or real time payments, coding or quantum computing, machine learning or mobile apps, FinTech or data science, the youth of India are a great example of how a society can embrace latest technology. In India, technology is not only about innovation but also about inclusion. Today, digital platforms are empowering the rights and dignity of people, while protecting privacy.

In the last nine years, over a billion people got a unique digital biometric identity connected with their bank accounts and mobile phones. This digital public infrastructure helps us reach citizens within seconds with financial assistance. Eight hundred and fifty million people receive direct benefit financial transfers into their accounts. Three times a year, over hundred million farmers receive assistance in their bank accounts at the click of a button. The value of such transfers has crossed three hundred and twenty billion dollars, and we have saved over twenty five billion dollars in the process. If you visit India, you will see everyone is using phones for payments, including street vendors.

Last year, out of every 100 real time digital payments in the world, 46 happened in India. Nearly four hundred thousand miles of optical fibre cables, and cheap data have ushered in a revolution of opportunities. Farmers check weather updates, the elderly get social security payments, students access scholarships, doctors deliver tele-medicine, fishermen check fishing grounds and small businesses get loans, with just a tap on their phones.

Mister Speaker,

A spirit of democracy, inclusion and sustainability defines us. It also shapes our outlook to the world. India grows while being responsible about our planet.

We believe:

माता भूमि: पुत्रो अहं पृथिव्या:

This means- ""the Earth is our Mother and we are her children.”

Indian culture deeply respects the environment and our planet. While becoming the fastest growing economy, we grew our solar capacity by Two Thousand Three Hundred Percent! Yes, you heard it right – Two Thousand Three Hundred Percent!

We became the only G20 country to meet its Paris commitment. We made renewables account for over forty percent of our energy sources, nine years ahead of the target of 2030. But we did not stop there. At the Glasgow Summit, I proposed Mission LiFE- Lifestyle for Environment. This is a way to make sustainability a true people’s movement. Not leave it to be the job of governments alone.

By being mindful in making choices, every individual can make a positive impact. Making sustainability a mass movement will help the world reach the Net Zero target faster. Our vision is pro-planet progress. Our vision is pro-planet prosperity. Our vision is pro-planet people.

Mister Speaker,

We live by the motto of वसुधैव कुटुंबकम or The World is One Family. Our engagement with the world is for everyone’s benefit. The ""One Sun, One World, One Grid” seeks to join us all in connecting the world with clean energy. ""One Earth, One Health” is a vision for global action to bring quality healthcare to everyone, including animals and plants.

The same spirit is also seen in the theme when we Chair the G20 – ""One Earth, One Family, One Future.” We advance the spirit of unity through Yoga as well. Just yesterday, the whole world came together to celebrate the International Day of Yoga. Just last week, all nations joined our proposal at the UN to build a Memorial Wall to honour the peacekeepers.

And this year, the whole world is celebrating the International Year of Millets, to promote sustainable agriculture and nutrition alike. During Covid, we delivered vaccines and medicines to over hundred and fifty countries. We reach out to others during disasters as first responders, as we do for our own. We share our modest resources with those who need them the most. We build capabilities, not dependencies.

Mister Speaker,

When I speak about India’s approach to the world, the United States occupies a special place. I know our relations are of great importance to all of you. Every Member of this Congress has a deep interest in it. When defence and aerospace in India grow, industries in the states of Washington, Arizona, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania thrive. When American companies grow, their research and development centres in India thrive. When Indians fly more, a single order for aircrafts creates more than a million jobs in forty four states in America.

When an American phone maker invests in India, it creates an entire ecosystem of jobs and opportunities, in both countries. When India and the US work together on semi-conductors and critical minerals, it helps the world in making supply chains more diverse, resilient and reliable. Indeed, Mister Speaker, we were strangers in defence cooperation at the turn of the century. Now, the United States has become one of our most important defence partners. Today India and the US are working together, in space and in the seas, in science and in semi-conductors, in start-ups and sustainability, in tech and in trade, in farming and finance, in art and artificial intelligence, in energy and education, in healthcare and humanitarian efforts.

I can go on and on. But, to sum it up, I would say,

The scope of our co-operation is endless,

The potential of our synergies is limitless,

And, the chemistry in our relations is effortless.

In all this, Indian Americans have played a big role. They are brilliant in every field, not just in Spelling Bee. With their hearts and minds, talent and skills, and their love for America and India, they have connected us; they have unlocked doors; they have shown the potential of our partnership.

Mister Speaker, Distinguished Members,

Every Indian Prime Minister and American President of the past has taken our relationship further. But our generation has the honour of taking it to greater heights. I agree with President Biden that this is a defining partnership of this century. Because it serves a larger purpose. Democracy, demography and destiny give us that purpose. One consequence of globalisation has been the over-concentration of supply chains.

We will work together to diversify, decentralize, and democratise supply chains. Technology will determine the security, prosperity and leadership in the Twenty First century. That is why our two countries established a new ""Initiative for Critical and Emerging Technologies.” Our knowledge partnership will serve humanity and seek solutions to the global challenges of climate change, hunger and health.

Mister Speaker and distinguished Members,

The last few years have seen deeply disruptive developments. With the Ukraine conflict, war has returned to Europe. It is causing great pain in the region. Since it involves major powers, the outcomes are severe. Countries of the Global South have been particularly affected. The global order is based on the respect for the principles of the UN Charter, peaceful resolution of disputes, and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.

As I have said directly and publicly, this is not an era of war. But, it is one of dialogue and diplomacy. And, we all must do what we can to stop the bloodshed and human suffering. Mister Speaker, The dark clouds of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo Pacific. The stability of the region has become one of the central concerns of our partnership.

We share a vision of a free, open and inclusive Indo Pacific, connected by secure seas, defined by international law, free from domination, and anchored in ASEAN centrality. A region where all nations, small and large, are free and fearless in their choices, where progress is not suffocated by impossible burdens of debt, where connectivity is not leveraged for strategic purposes, where all nations are lifted by the high tide of shared prosperity.

Our vision does not seek to contain or exclude, but to build a cooperative region of peace and prosperity. We work through regional institutions and with our partners from within the region and beyond. Of this, Quad has emerged as a major force of good for the region.

Mister Speaker,

More than two decades after 9/11 and more than a decade after 26/11 in Mumbai, radicalism and terrorism still remain a pressing danger for the whole world. These ideologies keep taking new identities and forms, but their intentions are the same. Terrorism is an enemy of humanity and there can be no ifs or buts in dealing with it. We must overcome all such forces sponsoring and exporting terror.

Mister Speaker,

COVID-19’s biggest impact was the human loss and suffering it caused. I wish to remember Congressman, Ron Wright and the staff members who lost their lives to Covid. As we emerge out of the pandemic, we must give shape to a new world order. Consideration, care and concern are the need of the hour. Giving a voice to the Global South is the way forward. That is why I firmly believe that the African Union be given full membership of G20.

We must revive multilateralism and reform multilateral institutions, with better resources and representation. That applies to all our global institutions of governance, especially the United Nations. When the world has changed, our institutions too must change. Or, risk getting replaced by a world of rivalries without rules. In working for a new world order based on international law, our two countries will be at the forefront, as partners.

Mister Speaker and Distinguished members,

Today, we stand at a new dawn in our relationship that will not only shape the destiny of our two nations, but also that of the world. As the young American Poet Amanda Gorman has expressed:

""When day comes we step out of the shade,

aflame and unafraid,

the new dawn blooms as we free it.

For there is always light,

if only we're brave enough to see it.”

Our trusted partnership is like the Sun in this new dawn that will spread light all around.

I am reminded of a poem that I once wrote :

आसमान में सिर उठाकर

घने बादलों को चीरकर

रोशनी का संकल्प लें

अभी तो सूरज उगा है ।

दृढ़ निश्चय के साथ चलकर

हर मुश्किल को पार कर

घोर अंधेरे को मिटाने

अभी तो सूरज उगा है।।

If I were to say it in English, it would be:

Raising its head in the skies,

Piercing through the dense clouds,

With the promise of light,

The sun has just risen.

Armed with a deep resolve,

Overcoming all the odds,

To dispel the forces of darkness,

The sun has just risen.

Mister Speaker and Distinguished Members,

We come from different circumstances and history, but we are united by a common vision. And, by a common destiny. When our partnership progresses, economic resilience increases, innovation grows, science flourishes, knowledge advances, humanity benefits, our seas and skies are safer, democracy will shine brighter, and the world will be a better place.

That is the mission of our partnership. That is our calling for this century. Mister Speaker and Distinguished members, Even by the high standards of our partnership, this visit is one of a great positive transformation. Together, we shall demonstrate that democracies matter and democracies deliver. I count on your continued support to the India-US partnership.

When I was here in 2016, I had said that ""our relationship is primed for a momentous future”. That future is today. Thank you once again Mister Speaker, Madam Vice-President and the Distinguished Members for this honour.

God Bless America.

Jai Hind.

Long Live India-US friendship.

It is always a great honour to address the United States Congress.

168,https://www.state.gov/briefings-foreign-press-centers/preview-of-minister-modi-visit/,Preview of the Upcoming State Visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Republic of India and News of the Day,,"THE WASHINGTON FOREIGN PRESS CENTER, WASHINGTON, D.C.

MODERATOR: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Washington Foreign Press Center. My name is Zina Wolfington and thank you all for coming today.

Today’s briefing is a preview of the upcoming state visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Republic of India and news of the day. As a reminder, the briefing is on the record, and we will post a transcript later today at fpc.state.gov.

I’m pleased to introduce John Kirby, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications. He will start with opening remarks, and then open for questions.

Over to you, John.

MR KIRBY: Thank you. How are you doing today? Everybody okay?

QUESTION: Great.

MR KIRBY: All right. Okay. So just give me a few minutes here at the top, if you will.

As you all know, this is a big week here at the White House, as the President and First Lady welcome the prime minister of India for an official state visit and dinner. It’s only the third such state dinner and visit of this administration.

This visit will affirm the deep and close partnership between the United States and India and the warm bonds of family and friendship that link Americans and Indians together. The visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space.

The leaders will discuss ways to further expand our educational exchanges and people-to-people ties, as well as our work together to confront common challenges, from climate change to workforce development and health security. As the world’s oldest and largest democracies and as key net security providers in the Indo-Pacific, the United States and India are increasingly partners of first resort as a combined force for global good.

India will be a critical strategic partner for the United States in the coming decades. India’s growing commitment to playing a more engaged international role, including in the Indo-Pacific Quad, demonstrates a new and growing willingness to join the United States to protect and advance a shared vision of a free, open, and rules-based global order.

As we think about the future of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and building resilient supply chains for clean energy technologies, semiconductors, and other critical and emerging technology, countering climate change, the future of our workforces, and global health, energy, food security, there is no partner more consequential than India.

Now, we’re hosting India for an official state visit to put our cooperation on an inexorable trajectory, as we support India’s emergence as a great power that will be central to ensuring U.S. interest in the coming decades. After years of strengthening our ties, the United States-India partnership is deeper and more expansive than it has ever been in the past. We now look instinctively to each other and work cooperatively with each other to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific, to drive innovation, jointly tackle global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Together and working with other likeminded partners, our countries will shape the future, working towards a world that, again, is open and more prosperous, more stable, more secure, and, quite frankly, more resilient.

Now I’ll take some questions. Let’s see. Who’s in the front here? Go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you, John. I wanted to touch a little bit if you could in the – how much Ukraine is going to be —

MODERATOR: (Off-mike.)

QUESTION: Oh, of course. Sorry. I’m Beatriz. I’m with EFE News Agency in Spanish. I wanted to ask about Ukraine. Ukraine has been proposing for months now the – they have been proposing a peace summit and they have expressed interest in having India as a participant in this global peace summit. So I was wondering if this will be part of the conversation between the President and Prime Minister Modi. And what is the stance of the United States regarding this summit, if this summit should take place, and if it should include Russia? Thank you.

MR KIRBY: So just to lay flat where we are on a peace summit, look, we all want to see this war end. We’d like to see it end today. And as I’ve said many times, it could end today if Mr. Putin would do the right thing and pull his troops out. Now, obviously, he’s not going to do that, and he’s doubling down, and there’s some pretty vicious fighting going on right now in the east and in the south of Ukraine.

We have said many times that we support President Zelenskyy’s vision of a just peace, and we’ve said many times that any discussion – any credible discussion, whether it’s at a summit or somewhere else or in smaller settings, any discussion – would be welcome only if it’s going to be credible and sustainable, which means that it has to start with a foundation of a belief in Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity and start – at least start – with a discussion of the 10-point proposal that President Zelenskyy has put forward. You’ve heard President Biden say a million times “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” That exists today.

Now, as for the role of other nations, we have also long said we would welcome the role of a third-party country involved in a peace process, and we believe that there could be such a role for a third-party country in the peace process. But again, in order for that role to be sustainable and to have any chance at success, it’s got to start with a complete understanding of the Ukrainian perspective here and a complete and commit – a complete and utter commitment to the UN Charter, to the idea of territorial integrity, to Ukraine’s sovereignty along its internationally recognized borders.

And then whether it’ll be discussed: There’s no doubt in my mind that the war in Ukraine will come up this week in the – during the state visit with Prime Minister Modi. No question about it. Now, to what degree specifically they’ll talk about a peace summit or a peace proposal, I can’t say right now. We’ll have to wait to hear from the leaders after it. But there’s no doubt in my mind that they will have a chance to talk about what’s going on in Ukraine.

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Thank you, John, for doing this. This is a very significant visit and you – we all are waiting for this visit, obviously. Do you think regional – oh, my name is Mushfiqul. I am representing Just News media and the South Asia perspectives. Do you think regional democratic stability and human rights situation will be discussed during the upcoming visit of the Indian prime minister as democracy and human rights are the key elements of the Biden-Harris administration’s foreign policy?

And quick on Bangladesh, United States already announced the visa policy to support free, fair, and inclusive election in Bangladesh. Do you think, as the largest democracy in the world, India will be with the United States effort to ensuring voting rights and restoring democracy in Bangladesh, as Bangladesh experienced two farcical election in 2014 and 2018 and we observe the Indian influence to keep Sheikh Hasina in power?

MR KIRBY: So on your first question, it is commonplace and consistent for President Biden to raise concerns over human rights wherever he goes around the world and whatever leaders he’s speaking to. Human rights are a foundational element of this administration’s foreign policy, and you can certainly expect that the President will – as he always does and as you can do with friends and partners like Prime Minister Modi in India – raise our concerns about that.

On Bangladesh, again, I think we’d let the Indian Government speak for its bilateral relations with Bangladesh. But you are correct: We have already made clear our desire to free and fair elections in Bangladesh, and you’re right, we adapted our visa policy to restrict travel to individuals who undermine Bangladeshi elections. So I can only speak for ourselves. You know where we are. We’ve been pretty public about that, but we would let the Indian Government talk about their bilateral relations.

Yes, ma’am.

QUESTION: So this is Ayushi Agarwal from ANI, Asia News International, New Delhi, India. I have two questions. My first question is regarding China. So China has blocked a proposal by India and U.S. at the United Nations to designate Lashkar-e Tayyiba terrorist Sajad Mir, wanted for his involvement in the 26/11 terrorist attacks as a global terrorist. Your reaction on that, please, since we know that Beijing has earlier repeatedly put hold on such listings.

My second question is since the prime minister is reaching Washington tomorrow, if you can elaborate more on the defense relationship between India and the U.S. How robust is it? And what areas of defense cooperation could we see some tangible outcomes during the prime minister’s visit? Because we know there are some defense deals on the agenda.

Thank you.

MR KIRBY: So on your first question, I think I’d just – our belief in that designation I think speaks for itself, and I’d leave it there.

On your second question, you’re right, there is a very robust defense cooperation between the United States and India, and we are working and will continue to work to see if we can improve and deepen that defense cooperation. You will see – again, I don’t want to get ahead of the two leaders – but the issue of defense cooperation and deepening that, bolstering it, strengthening it, expanding it into areas like cyber and space and emerging technologies, all of that will be on the agenda here with the state visit. And again, I think you’ll hear more from the leaders afterward.

India is a sovereign nation, of course, and they get to make their own decisions about the partnerships that they explore and the cooperation that they enjoy with other countries. We’re very comfortable that under this administration and with President Biden’s leadership, we have really worked hard to advance the level of defense cooperation between our two countries. Because, as I said – I don’t know, probably may have mentioned it seven times in my opening statement – because with the Indians we certainly jointly believe in a safe and secure, prosperous, and open Indo-Pacific region, and Prime Minister Modi and the – and India are key players in trying to achieve that vision. So it only makes sense that we would look for ways to improve our defense cooperation. And again, I think you’ll see more coming out of this week and as the leaders have a chance to summarize what they discussed.

Yes, ma’am. Yeah.

QUESTION: Thank you, Admiral Kirby. Bingru Wang with Honk Kong Phoenix TV. Is one of the main purpose to invite Prime Minister Modi to the United States is to counter China’s influence in Indo-Pacific?

MR KIRBY: No.

QUESTION: And secondly, I would like to take this opportunity to ask you about the White House and President Biden’s assessment of Secretary Blinken’s trip to Beijing. In China there are critics questioning the United States sincerity saying actions and words are inconsistent. So how can you prevent – how can you actually keep the momentum Secretary Blinken built in Beijing to prevent it from derail?

MR KIRBY: Well, that’s the goal. First of all, you heard the President talk about this himself over the weekend that he felt like Secretary Blinken did a terrific job on this trip to Beijing. You have to remember the goal here was to get even more lines of communication open and to try to advance this competition that we’re in in a responsible way. And Secretary Blinken has spoken to this himself as he left Beijing that he felt like his visit helped get that process back on track. And that’s what we were focused on.

And now it remains for both sides to do what we can to drive that – from the initial conversations we had, to drive them forward to meaningful results. So the answer to your question is we’re going to see. And I can assure you that the Biden administration will do everything that we can to achieve that goal and to work towards that end. And you head Secretary Blinken say as well that now that he has visited it’s possible now – and we hope – that you’ll see other high-level officials heading off to Beijing.

Now, we still have work to do, which is one of the takeaways from this was establishing a team approach at lower levels for both countries, lower-level diplomats to start working together to see if we can’t still stitch together and improve some of the lines of communication that are not and still have not been agreed to reopen. And the one I’m speaking about chiefly is of course the military-to-military line, which the Chinese did not agree to. It doesn’t mean it’s never going to happen. That’s why it’s important for the two teams now to work together to see what we can do to get that moving forward. At a time right now when tensions are high, particularly in the security realm, it is that much more important that the military channels find a way to get opened up here so that we can have more conversation, more dialogue, to reduce the risk of miscalculation.

Yeah. I promise, I’ll work around. I promise. I’ve got an hour. I’m not going anywhere.

QUESTION: Thank you so much, Admiral. Welcome back, as usual. Alex Raufoglu from Turan News Agency. I’m just wondering how much of the fact that India purchases Russian oil and gas, which allows Putin to fund his war in Ukraine, is problematic when it comes to Russia – U.S.-Ukraine – U.S.-Iran – Indian relationship. And what is the strategy here in terms of, let’s say, touching upon these sort of topics when President meets (inaudible) with Prime Minister Modi? Is the strategy we should stick with the friendly topics as long as we’re okay with our relationship, just avoid – as long as we don’t talk about issues such as purchasing Russian oil? Or to raise this concern and get him and the same (inaudible) you mentioned that you are – you prefer to have rule-based order, and is that your expectation from Prime Minister Modi to highlight that?

More broadly, a second question.

MR KIRBY: That was only one question?

QUESTION: Level of concern just (inaudible) —

MR KIRBY: You’ve got to be kidding me?

QUESTION: What’s your level of concern when it comes to Russia evading sanctions? The administration recently named the names, five countries you guys highlighted from Kazakhstan to Armenia, to Georgia, to Türkiye. Now, some of them are Russian partners. I understand when it comes to countries such as Georgia, which in itself suffers from Russian invasion. What can you do about it to prevent this from happening?

MR KIRBY: About sanctions evasion from whom?

QUESTION: From countries such as Georgia and other countries that are helping Russia to evade the sanctions when it comes to electronics and other.

MR KIRBY: Well look, on the sanctions evasions question, I mean, this is why we have constant dialogue with allies and partners and friends in the region and around the world. We don’t want to see anybody try to skirt these sanctions. We want to see Mr. Putin held to account and the Kremlin held to account.

Now, obviously every nation has to make these decisions for themselves, but our view has been very clear. We want to see all the international sanctions ascribed to and enforced appropriately so that Mr. Putin can’t benefit. And we have no compunction about having conversations privately with allies, partners, and friends throughout the world, certainly on the European continent, about our concerns in that regard. But obviously we wouldn’t get into detailing what the diplomatic conversations are.

On your – on the first 17 questions that you asked, look, let me boil it down this way. India is a key and important partner not just in the Indo-Pacific but globally for the United States. In fact, it’s one of the most defining bilateral relationships in the world. Now, and if you just look ahead, look at where things are going, not just – not just in that region but elsewhere, I think it’s safe to say that it’s going to be one of the most defining and important bilateral relationships well into the future.

And so in the context of that, you can expect that over the next few days President Biden and Prime Minister Modi will have wide-ranging discussions about a lot of issues. Some issues are always easier to talk about than others, but that’s what partners do. You have those kinds of conversations. I’m not going to get ahead of them, and I’m certainly not going to speak for either leader until they have a chance to speak for themselves at the end of their visits and meetings. But I think you will see that the agenda that they end up discussing is very robust and covers a lot of issues.

And as I’ve said earlier, President Biden never shies away, nor would you expect him to, from having conversations with foreign leaders about issues that – on which we don’t always see eye to eye. That’s important. That’s why you have visits. That’s why you have meetings. That’s why you have these discussions so that you can work through all of those things.

But this is not only a very important visit for us, but this is a hugely important bilateral relationship that the President and his entire team – Secretary of State Blinken, Secretary of Defense Austin, the Secretary of Commerce – have all put a lot of energy into, including the Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry – all of whom have put a lot of effort into in seeing in ways we can deepen and improve our cooperation and our relationship with India. And again, I think you’re going to see that on full display this week.

Yeah, in the back there. Go ahead. The orange tie.

QUESTION: Admiral Kirby, good to see you. I’m Saurabh Shula from NewsMobile in India. You spoke about India as a defining – India’s partnership with the U.S. as a defining partnership for the next decade. Can you spell out what are the three big outcomes that you are expecting from this state visit, because there’s a lot of expectation here in the U.S., in India, and rest of the world, and people are watching very closely this big state visit of Prime Minister Narendra —

MR KIRBY: Yeah. I think, again, without getting ahead of the leaders, I think you’ll – you can expect to see meaningful, tangible, deliverables in several different categories. One will be on health, global health. And I talked about the pandemic a little bit earlier in my opening comments, but we cooperated very, very strongly with India to address COVID-19, and I think you’ll hear the leaders talk about global health cooperation going forward.

I think you’ll hear, as I said earlier just in my previous answer, you’re going to see them talk about deliverables in the realm of the climate crisis and addressing climate change. You’ll certainly hear them talk about defense cooperation. I’ve already talked about that a lot. I think you’ll hear some discussion and deliverables with respect to emerging technologies, and I’m going to lump space in there, although it’s probably not fair for me to do that. But space and emergent technologies, cyberspace – I think you’ll see some deliverables in that regard.

And then lastly – and by lastly, I don’t mean that it’s least important; in fact, in many ways, it’s the most important – but it’s the peopletopeople ties. And you’re going to hear both of these leaders talk about ways in which we can make more enriching the people-to-people, cultural, educational exchanges that we already have, deepening them, making them more meaningful, because that really is the root of the strength of the bilateral relationship 10, 15 years out in the future. It’s going to be the young people that are going to be the future leaders of both their countries, and so we want to make sure that we’re investing properly in their growth, in their development, in their mutual understanding, and in the relationships that they will take forward into the future. So there’s going to be an awful lot on the agenda, but those are sort of the top five areas that I would cite.

Let me come over here, ma’am. Yeah.

QUESTION: Thank you very much. Christiane Jacke from the German Press Agency DPA. I have a quick follow-up on China on the Secretary Blinken’s visit. Now that you are working on – actively working on opening up the lines of communication, how likely or unlikely is a bilateral, like face-to-face meeting between President Biden, President Xi in India at the G7 and G20 Summit and in San Francisco at the APEC Summit later this year?

And if I might add a super-fast second question, is there any timeline for the President’s trip to Africa this year already?

MR KIRBY: So on both questions, I really don’t have anything on the schedule to speak to, either a trip to the continent or to a meeting with President Xi. You heard the President over the weekend say that he does expect to be meeting and connecting with President Xi at the appropriate time, and he’ll do that. Whether that occurs at the G20 or not, I just can’t say right now.

It is important that Secretary Blinken was able to make this trip to Beijing. It’s just as, if not more, important that our two teams now start to work on improving the lines of communication between our two countries, and hopefully that will involve follow-on visits by other cabinet officials. We’ll see where that goes.

And clearly, as the President has said many, many times, that President Xi is a leader who he has known for a very, very long time. They have spoken many times. They had a terrific three- hour meeting in Bali, and he looks forward to having follow-on conversations and discussions with President Xi in the future. And that will happen. And when it does, and we have something more to say about that, we certainly will.

Yeah, in the blue.

QUESTION: Thank you so much, Mr. Kirby. I appreciate it. Igor Naymushin of RIA Novosti News Agency, Washington Bureau. So two questions, first one about Russian oil revenues. The U.S. administration has always been very clear that each country should make its own choice whether to buy Russian oil or not. Whether – nevertheless, if we’re looking at such a dramatic growth of Indian imports of Russian oil, doesn’t it concern the White House that all efforts to decrease Russian oil revenues results only in shifting its supply chains?

And the second question is about defense cooperation and arm trades. Is the U.S. administration committed to displace Russia from the Indian arms market and decrease its share? Thank you so much.

MR KIRBY: So on your first question, the price cap is working. It has proven effective in limiting the amount of revenue that Mr. Putin can take from his oil exports and the market to then turn around and fund this war in Ukraine. It’s working, and we’re gratified to see that, and we certainly hope that, in the case of India, that they will continue to purchase oil inside the cap. Now, obviously, that’s for them to decide. We don’t tell other nations how to handle their bilateral relations, so I won’t speak for the Modi government, but we hope that they will continue to buy in keeping with the cap, because it is working and it is having an effect on (A) keeping the supply in the market stable but (B) not allowing Mr. Putin to profiteer off of it.

And then on the arms market question, again, India should and must speak for itself when it comes to the relationships that it has around the world, particularly in the realm of defense. So I won’t speak for the – Prime Minister Modi or the Indian Government and where and how they see their defense cooperation going forward. All I can tell you is what I said earlier, that we have seen in recent years, particularly since the beginning of the Biden administration, that defense cooperation between our two countries has improved, and we are looking – and you’ll see quite a focus on it this week in particular – we’re looking to deepen that, to broaden it, and to find opportunities to improve that defense cooperation between the – between India and the United States. And again, I – without getting ahead of where things are, I think you’ll see that that will come to pass here before the end of the week. And that’s all to the good because we have a shared interest and a shared common goal of a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific, and India is a major exporter of security in the Indo-Pacific region, and they certainly have equities of their own to speak to.

So we’re looking forward to where this is going. It’s not about – the question about whether this was about China. This state visit is also not about Russia, and what we’re trying to do with our bilateral relationship with India is improve the bilateral relationship on its own – for its own sake and on its own foundation, because it’s that important to us. It’s not about forcing or coercing or trying to convince Prime Minister Modi or the Indian Government to do something different. It’s about focusing on where we are in this relationship and making it more important, more robust, more cooperative going forward. That’s what our focus is.

Yeah.

QUESTION: Thank you. Lalit Jha from PTI. How would you describe the evolution of this relationship in the last nine years under the Modi government?

And secondly, we are – in defense cooperation, we’re talking about co-production, co-development. These are long-term things. But in the short term, when India has more challenging needs from the neighbors north and west, in what way U.S. and India can cooperate, coordinate together in which India can successfully address those challenges coming from the neighborhoods, including its territorial integrity?

MR KIRBY: Well, I think you’re going to see that play out this week, Lalit. I mean, you’re going to see some robust discussion here about improving our defense cooperation with a deep and solemn respect for Indian prerogatives and Indian choices, and certainly with a recognition that India’s a sovereign state and must choose for itself the direction it wants to take in terms of its own security and the regional security that it is increasingly providing – exporting security.

We certainly want to be a part of that discussion with India. We certainly want to be a part of that future with India. But we certainly respect that these are decisions that India has to make, and as I said earlier, you’re going to see as – over the course of this week – and I won’t – the leaders will speak for themselves about some of the ways we’re going to specifically improve and deepen defense cooperation.

Now, on your first question, look, I’m not qualified to speak about the last nine years of Prime Minister Modi’s leadership. All I can tell you is in the last two and a half years under this administration, President Biden has really put a premium in general, broadly speaking, on revitalizing our vast network of alliances and partnerships, and India is one of those key strategic partners. And they have been just a huge part of the Quad, the Pacific Quad. I think, as you know, we also look for ways to work more cooperatively with India multilaterally through the I2U2 arrangement, largely focused on the Middle East. So there’s an awful lot – not to mention just the bilateral opportunities between us in trade, in investments, and as I said earlier, in people-to-people ties.

So we’re focused on the future. And I really do believe – at the risk of sounding like I’m being corny here, I really do believe that at the end of the week when these two leaders have a chance to summarize their discussions, you’re going to see that the discussion this week was really focused on the future – the future of this bilateral relationship but also the future of the Indo-Pacific region writ large.

Let me go back over here. Yes, ma’am, in the front there. I’ll come back to you.

QUESTION: Seema Sirohi I’m a columnist for The Economic Times in India, an Indian newspaper. U.S. officials have raised expectations high about this visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. That is a kind of a sea change from just a few years ago, so when India was, let’s say, a second-tier interest – of interest. India was a second-tier country in terms of U.S. interest. It was all about Pakistan, China, and U.S. sort of focusing on that. So what changed from your point of view, from the U.S. point of view, that now India is everything? It’s the country of the future.

MR KIRBY: Well, all I can tell you is that in President Biden’s mind, India is not a second-tier anything. India matters significantly to President Biden and to this administration, and not just in South Asia or the Indo-Pacific region but truly globally. And again, I don’t – I don’t want to sound like a broken record, but I think when you see some of the deliverables coming out of this visit, you’ll see the true global impact of some of the ways in which our bilateral relationship is really acting not just for the betterment of our two peoples or any one region of the world but truly around the world. So you’ll see that come out of this.

All I – again, the only way I can answer your question is to sort of say what I’ve said before. Coming into office, President Biden saw that our relationships around the world in many cases, many places, were eroding, tattering, and trust and confidence in the United States as a partner, a friend, in some cases an ally, was beginning to fade. And he immediately set forth an assertive but cooperative foreign policy to revitalize those relationships, because President Biden knows that there’s very few problems around the world that any one nation can solve for itself. We need each other.

We absolutely – when you look at certainly the transnational problem, whether it’s terrorism, whether it’s the next pandemic, climate change, those – global health, food security, energy security – I could go on and on. When you look at the problem set before leaders like Prime Minister Modi and President Biden, it’s pretty easy to see that you gotta to have teamwork here, and that some nations can bring to the problem solving set skills and experience, technologies, innovation, investments that another nation may not be able to put forward, and so together you can really have an outsized impact.

And the President has long believed that. And when he came into office, again, he set forward a foreign policy that was going to focus on that, on the benefit of multilateral cooperation and to restoring some of the trust and confidence that had been eroded in the United States ability to lead on the world stage. And that’s what he’s doing.

And I think – again, you don’t have to – look multilaterally. Look at the – look at what President Biden’s leadership has done with respect to supporting Ukraine – not just bolstering and strengthening the NATO Alliance, which is now bigger than it was when President Biden came into office, but around the world. More than 50 nations around the world are coming together on a routine basis about every six weeks to find ways to continue to support Ukraine. And India has been a terrific contributor of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine but also bilaterally in working at the grassroots level in bilateral relationships to address common concerns and move towards the achievement of common goals with shared interests. And that’s exactly what you’re going to see on display here this week.

Yes, sir. In the aisle there with the white shirt.

QUESTION: Thank you. Diyar Kurda, Rudaw Media Network. I will take this opportunity to ask a question about northeast Syria. Türkiye hastened its fight – it is airstrikes and also drone strikes on northeast Syria. Today they attacked – they targeted a car, and they killed the co-chair of the —

MR KIRBY: I’m sorry. Who conducted this attack?

QUESTION: Türkiye.

MR KIRBY: Türkiye. Okay.

QUESTION: Yeah. Türkiye, the Kurds, the drone attack on a car which they killed Qamishli cochair municipality and also three other people, which they were civilians. Do you have any engagement with Türkiye and also SDF to de-escalate the situation?

MR KIRBY: I have not seen those reports, sir, so I’m going to – I’m going to decline comment on that particular reporting because I’ve just not seen that.

I would just reiterate our mission inside Syria is in part of the – as part of the Counter-ISIS coalition, we do work with the SDF to go after ISIS targets because ISIS is still, although much weaker, still a viable threat there in Syria and even in Iraq. So we’re going to continue that work jointly in cooperation with our SDF partners.

We have – again, without speaking to this particular reporting, we have certainly maintained lines of communication open with Türkiye. Türkiye has legitimate security concerns on that border. They have been victim of – they have fallen victim to terrorist attacks from across that border. We understand that. We also understand it’s important to make sure that Türkiye understands what we’re doing in Syria and why we’re doing it and who we’re working with and why we’re working with them. But again, I can’t go into any more detail than that.

Yes, ma’am. Yeah. No, right behind. There. Yeah. She’s had her hand up all day. Go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you so much, Mr. Kirby. Ines Pohl with Deutsche Welle. This is Germany’s international broadcaster. I have two questions. Given Vice President Kamala Harris and family bonds with India, which role does she play during this state visit? Is it different from other state visits?

And my second question is how important is it in your opinion for the Americans with Indian roots that President Biden addresses human rights issues in India? Thank you.

MR KIRBY: So the Vice President is going to be a full party to this state visit, as you might imagine, and I know she will be having opportunities, including a lunch that she’ll be hosting for the prime minister and his staff to engage specifically and directly with the prime minister. And I’ll let her office speak to that with more detail, but she’s looking forward to that. And you’re right; I mean, her family heritage is certainly noteworthy with respect to this visit.

And then on the question of human rights, I know there are millions, several millions of Indian Americans here in this country, and we understand that they, as actually anybody, would have concerns over human and civil rights. And as I said earlier, we don’t shy away from addressing those concerns privately. We don’t shy away from addressing those concerns publicly. And everywhere the President goes, where and when it’s appropriate and when it’s a significant issue, he raises those concerns. And again, I don’t think that this week will be any exception to that.

So we certainly understand where people are coming from on that, and I can assure them, Indian Americans but all Americans, that this is something the President takes seriously. And certainly, we’ll address it.

Yeah.

QUESTION: Thank you. My name is Pavel Zakovorotnyy. I’m from Sputnik News, Russia. Two quick questions. First, do you believe Prime Minister Modi shares President Biden’s view of the conflict in Ukraine, including the massive sanctions against Russia, and does it pose any challenge for the bilateral relations if not?

MR KIRBY: Does it pose any challenge for the —

QUESTION: For the bilateral relations with India.

And my second question is about the Black Sea Grain deal. The Russian foreign ministry today said that the grain deal will likely end on July 18th without extension because neither of Russian conditions have been fulfilled by the Western countries. Do you have any comments here and do you think that Russia has benefitted at all from the Black Sea Grain deal?

MR KIRBY: The whole world has benefitted from this Black Sea Grain Initiative, and we’re grateful to President Erdogan of Türkiye and his leadership in keeping that initiative going, and the UN of course keeping that initiative going and extending. And we’ve seen the comments that are deeply unfortunate that Russia would signal that there may not be an extension. This initiative has benefitted people around the world, particularly in the so-called Global South, who have suffered from food insecurity as a result of Russians’ – the Russian war in Ukraine.

So we certainly hope that it will get extended. We will continue to support, as needed, the UN and President Erdogan as appropriate in terms of seeing if we can’t get that extended, because it really – it does matter to people well outside the region.

And as for your first question, I think that’s a question that I would refer to Prime Minister Modi. I mean, he should speak to his government’s view of the war in Ukraine and the degree to which they believe Mr. Putin is being held accountable for the war there. We know that they have contributed humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. That’s welcome. And through statements and through votes at the UN, India has made clear its deep concern about what Russia is doing inside Ukraine.

We talked about oil. Again, the Indians should speak for themselves when it comes to the oil they buy, but we certainly hope that they will continue to purchase it at or below the price cap levels, which they have.

So again, I think the broader question that you’re asking, though, is really one that’s better put to them, not to us.

Yeah, in the back there. Go ahead. Wait. Wait for the microphone. s

QUESTION: Thank you, Admiral. Sriram Lakshman from The Hindu. My question is: What is the administration’s strategy to ensure that the long list of deliverables from this visit and going forward – deliverables which are derived from the iCET platform, for example – what’s the strategy to ensure that they don’t keep running up against ITAR and other legislation? Because I understand that it may not be an issue for the jet engines, for example, but this is a medium- to long-term issue. So are you thinking of a carveout, to push Congress on a carveout, reimagine ITAR? What’s the strategy there?

MR KIRBY: Oh, you’re getting further ahead than where I’m prepared to go here today. I would just tell you that you’re going to see a robust set of deliverables across all those five areas I talked about earlier: climate change, technology, space, cyber, people-to-people, and certainly defense cooperation. And we will, as we have in this and any other bilateral relationship, work closely with Congress so that they’re fully informed and fully – and able to fully support the kinds of things that we want to continue to do bilaterally with India. But I won’t go into more detail than that.

Yes, ma’am.

QUESTION: Hi, yes, Yasmine El-Sabawi, TRT World. I know you touched on the human rights issue more broadly, but if you could speak to this specifically, the Council on American-Islamic Relations are urging members of Congress not to attend Prime Minister Modi’s address. We’ve seen from human rights organizations they’ve widely documented attempts by the Modi government, they say, of disenfranchising Muslims, turning a blind eye to widespread acts of violence. We’ve seen this administration and Republicans be quite outspoken about China’s crackdown on its Muslim minority. And so why in this case is a red carpet being rolled out for Prime Minister Modi?

MR KIRBY: So the question really gets to the importance of a state visit, and a state visit is not just about the red carpet and a terrific meal. It is about anchoring the relationship through a wide-ranging and very robust agenda of significant policy issues, and you’re going to see that this week, as I said earlier.

So why India? Why now? Take a look at the region. Take a look at the way in which this bilateral relationship has improved in the last two and a half years. And just as critically, take a look at where this relationship is going to be going in the next 10, 15 years and how vital this bilateral relationship will be not just to regional security but global security. All of that is reason enough to have a set of robust discussions and meetings and conversations with India about the future. And again, I don’t want to get ahead of the deliverables, but you’ll see, I think – well, I know what you’ll see – at the end of the week the full scope of the agenda and what we were able – what we hope to be able to get done sitting down with Mr. – Prime Minister Modi and his team.

That doesn’t mean that – democracy is tough. We know that. We’ve seen it firsthand here in this country. It’s tough; you’ve got to work at it. And India has a vibrant democracy, and they, too, work at it. No democracy at any given point in time reaches perfection. The idea of democracy is that you try to become more perfect – language that was in our own Constitution. And so we’re going to continue to work on this bilateral relationship between these two vibrant, relevant, strong, and influential democracies in the world to improve the relationship. And that means that in so doing, we’re also going to have conversations – we can have and we need to have somewhat uncomfortable conversations with our partners and our friends and our allies. That’s what you can do when you have – when you’re partners and friends and allies, is have conversations about uncomfortable issues.

And as I said, President Biden has never shied away from raising concerns over human rights, and he’s not going to start shying away from it this week. But that doesn’t mean that you also don’t discuss other areas where you are in full agreement about making the relationship stronger and more robust going forward, and we’ll do that.

But I find it interesting that the – and I’m not saying you suggested this, but the supposition is that if you have concerns with another nation, you – that you – that the way to address it is to not talk about it, to not – to not address it, to ignore it. And we obviously aren’t going to do that, nor are we – nor should we, and it would be irresponsible for us to ignore all the great opportunities and the promises that exist between these two countries going forward. And again, you’re going to see – you’re going to see a set of discussions and conversations that are very much focused on the future, a future that this bilateral relationship will be critical to.

I can take just a couple more. Yeah.

QUESTION: Hi, this is Jihan Abdalla from The National. I have actually two questions. The first – the West Bank, in Jenin – we’ve seen an incursion yesterday. Five were killed. Seems like another escalation in a part of the West Bank that’s on and off. What do you have to say about that?

The second question, about Iran – again, Israel has had a lot to say about this alleged deal, mini-deal, whatever we’re going to call it, with Iran.

MR KIRBY: Well, we’re not calling it a mini-deal.

QUESTION: (Laughter.) Agreement or whatever. Yes, any comments on how to counter what seems to be a lot of criticism from also U.S. lawmakers themselves and Israel’s distaste for it?

MR KIRBY: So on your first question, I mean, I’m only vaguely familiar with some of these initial reports, so I don’t know that I can speak specifically to them. But in general, we have said and we continue to say we don’t want to see any actions taken by either side to increase tensions. And we certainly don’t want to see violence by either side here. We want to see – what we want to see is a real commitment to de-escalating the tensions and stopping the violence. So I’ll leave it at that.

On your second question, there’s no deal to speak to. We have and we will continue to talk to the Iranians about detained Americans in their country, and we’re doing that, and we’re going to continue to do that because the President has made it a commitment to get wrongfully detained Americans back home with their families where they belong. And so that discussion’s ongoing.

At the same time, we’re certainly dealing with the full spate of destabilizing behaviors that we see out of Tehran, whether it’s attacking maritime shipping, which again happened just the last couple of weeks; their continuing efforts to improve their ballistic missile program; their support to terrorist networks in the Levant and throughout the region; and as – just as critically, their continued and deepening defense relationship with Russia and the support that they’re helping provide Russia in order so Russia can kill more Ukrainians. And I’m talking specifically about the provision of drones, and now indications that they’re going to help Moscow build a drone manufacturing facility on Russian soil.

So we’re going to deal with all that destabilizing behavior. And we’ve said, when it comes to their nuclear ambitions, I mean, clearly President Biden – well, I’ll start with this. He has made it clear that we will not allow Iran to achieve a nuclear weapons capability. He would prefer for us to be able to deal – to achieve that outcome through diplomacy. Right now, diplomacy in that realm is not on the table. It’s just – we’re not pursuing diplomacy towards their nuclear ambitions. But that doesn’t mean that the President still hasn’t committed himself to trying to have that solved diplomatically, if possible. Right now, that’s not the scope of the discussions that we’re having with Iran for a variety of reasons, some of which I just mentioned to you. And that means that the President wants and has available to him other options to make sure that that the outcome of a nuclear-armed Iran doesn’t become – doesn’t become possible.

I can take just one more. Yeah, in the – go ahead. No, wait for your microphone.

QUESTION: (Off-mike.)

MR KIRBY: Okay, one more after that. You’re the last one.

QUESTION: Prashant Jha, Hindustan Times. Is there anything India is doing at the moment that U.S. would like to see Delhi do differently?

MR KIRBY: (Laughter.) We are very excited about this visit and about deepening and improving this bilateral relationship. And we wouldn’t have – President Biden wouldn’t have invented – invented – (laughter) – wouldn’t have invited Prime Minister Modi if he wasn’t strong and confident in the manner in which this bilateral relationship truly has deepened in the last two and a half years. And so we’re excited about that and we look forward to talking about it at the end of the week.

Yeah.

QUESTION: Thank you for taking my question. My name Malvika Jain. I’m from Times Now, a part of India’s largest news network. I have two questions for you. One is more specifically regarding Ukraine. You mentioned that there is a possibility for a third country to act as a mediator if certain conditions are met. Could that country be India?

And my second question is that in response to a question regarding human rights violations, you mentioned that U.S. will not refrain and has never refrained from expressing concerns if they are legitimate. Does U.S. believe that the prime minister was in violation of human rights issues? Because the supreme court of India has found no evidence against the prime minister, specifically in the case of the state of Gujarat, where he was a chief minister.

MR KIRBY: On the second question, I’m just going to leave it where I left it before. We routinely raise human rights concerns with our friends, our allies, our partners, even nations that we’re not so friendly with. We’re not bashful about raising those concerns, and we’ll continue to do that. And I think I’m just going to leave it there.

On your first question, could India be – I mean, that would obviously be up to Prime Minister Modi to determine whether he wanted India to take an assertive role in helping bring about a peace deal between Russia in Ukraine. I can just tell you what we’ve said before, which is we would welcome a constructive role played by a third-party country, whoever it is – we’ve said this about China as well – as long as it (A) included the perspectives of President Zelenskyy and factored in his own proposal for a just peace; (B) that it was work that was done in keeping with the principles of the UN Charter, to include sovereignty and territorial integrity being respected in Ukraine by internationally recognized borders; and (C) that it’s done in full transparency with President Zelenskyy. As President Biden has said, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. And so any peace proposal put forward by anybody that didn’t include Ukrainian perspectives is just a non-starter, not just for us, but for the Ukrainian people, and that’s to be well understood.

So, again, that’s a question that only Prime Minister Modi can answer. But certainly, we would welcome any credible, sustainable effort by a third-party country, again, as long as it met those guidelines and could be seen as credible and potentially sustainable by President Zelenskyy.

Now, look, I want to go back to one last thing I said – one thing I said at the beginning. We’d all like to see peace in Ukraine, and ideally that could happen today. We know it’s not. We know there’s a lot of vicious fighting going on. We know that Mr. Putin has prepared himself and continues to throw military capabilities into Ukraine, continues to launch drone and missile strikes inside – sometimes deep inside – Ukraine, and has continued in every way possible to continue to propagate this war and to further victimize the Ukrainian people, which is why President Biden and the United States is going to continue to support them in the battlefield as much as we can, so that if and when this can get to negotiations, President Zelenskyy can go into those negotiations from a position of strength, with the wind at his back, knowing that they have succeeded on the battlefield.

So that’s what we’re focused on, making sure that Ukraine can succeed on the battlefield, and other nations – some 50 other nations – are doing the same thing. And some nations – every nation has to decide for itself. Some are contributing other than security assistance, and that’s okay too. All of this is about sovereignty. I’ve said this the last time I was here, and so many of the questions I’ve gotten today really get at this idea of sovereignty. Every nation has to decide for itself what other countries it’s going to relate to and what those relations are going to look like, where and how much oil it buys, whether it’s going to support Ukraine with weapons or humanitarian assistance or nothing. Those are – the whole war in Ukraine is really about the idea of sovereignty and territorial integrity. It’s really about that UN Charter.

And so that’s what – when I – when we talk about a rules-based order – and that is something that Prime Minister Modi has been very clear about supporting, a rules-based order – that’s what we’re talking about. That’s what this discussion will all get around. And I think, again, as you look at the bilateral relationship between our two countries and the discussions that we’re going to have this week, you’ll see that it really does come down to respect for each other, respect for our democratic institutions, respect for the burgeoning and deepening defense cooperation that we’re enjoying now and we want to enjoy in the future, and – my last point – respect, again, for that future, for that future in the Indo-Pacific which has got to be secure, open, prosperous, and which we believe – President Biden believes – India is going to be a critical partner that.

Okay. Thanks, everybody. Appreciate it."
169,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/20/india-modi-visit-united-states/70325476007/,Here's why Democrats and Republicans welcome a visit from right-wing Indian PM Narendra Modi,2023-06-20 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden and congressional leaders will roll out the red carpet for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, as the right-wing Hindu nationalist leader arrives for an official state visit to the United States.

Modi will address a joint session of Congress and will be feted at a White House state dinner — a diplomatic honor usually reserved for close allies. On Sunday, many Indian Americans took to the streets in major cities across the country for an ""India Unity Day"" march to welcome Modi to the U.S.

The marches, organized by the American overseas arm of Modi's right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, were a show of support for the controversial Indian leader who has faced criticism for presiding over human rights violations, an erosion of the country's democracy, and a crackdown in Indian-controlled Kashmir.

That Democrats and Republicans alike are honoring Modi this week demonstrates the White House and Congress are willing to overlook his right-wing populist agenda in the pursuit of a strategically important relationship that will allow the U.S. to counter China's influence.

Why the U.S. relationship with India is 'strategically important'

Meanwhile, Modi's political allies in Washington stepped up their lobbying efforts with members of Congress and the Biden administration ahead of his official state visit this week.

Sanjay Puri, the chairman and founder of the bipartisan U.S.-India Political Action Committee (USINPAC), said that in their lobbying efforts, the group has sought to underscore that India is ""the only democracy in that region"" and emphasize that the rise of China resulted in the U.S.-India partnership becoming a ""strategically important relationship.""

""That's been our push,"" Puri said of the group's discussions with lawmakers ahead of Modi's visit. ""It has resulted in, obviously, the [congressional] leadership asking him to come in and speak and also President Biden inviting him for a state dinner as well as several other activities around that.""

In addition to combatting American criticism of the Indian government's human rights record, the welcome marches likely also sought to enhance Modi's political image at home ahead of a general election next year, according to Gautam Nair, a professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School.

""This visit actually should buttress his domestic political standing,"" Nair, who was born and raised in India, said. ""And these rallies sort of suggest, or help foster an image, that he is an international leader of stature as well.""

Mukesh Aghi, president of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, said the ""the Indian diaspora is quite excited about what Modi is doing, excited about the direction of the country, and feel proud of their heritage.""

Countering China

Modi's visit also comes just days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with senior Chinese officials in Beijing over the weekend, a bid to improve relations between the two superpowers after months of heightened tensions. Washington has increasingly looked to forge closer ties with New Delhi to counter China's rising political and economic influence.

Nair said he believes the rationale for giving Modi the star treatment during his visit to the United States is ""quite clear.""

""This extra effort is because traditionally India has been wary of forging formal alliances with great powers,"" Nair said. ""This is reflected in the fact that on the one hand, defense ties, diplomatic ties, economic ties are deepening with the United States, and at the same time China is a huge trading partner for India.""

Aghi said he expects Modi's visit to yield a deal that will allow General Electric to manufacture jet engines in India for the country's military aircrafts, in addition to fostering discussions on healthcare and artificial intelligence between the two countries.

""I think what we're seeing is a much more deeper collaboration on technology, investments, and defense,"" Aghi said.

How this U.S.-India partnership could be one of the most significant in a century

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who serves as a co-chair of the U.S.-India congressional caucus, told USA TODAY he believes the ""U.S.-India partnership will be one of the most significant of this century.""

""We will be working to strengthen the technology and defense relationship and to promote scientific research and cooperation on climate change initiatives,"" Khanna said.

Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a 2024 Republican presidential candidate and the daughter of Indian immigrants, said she also welcomed the decision to invite Modi for an official state visit.

""India is a critically important country in the Indo-Pacific region and a natural ally of America with so many shared values and interests,"" Haley told USA TODAY. ""It is entirely appropriate that Prime Minister Modi should address Congress and be celebrated at the White House.""

Biden and American political leaders, however, have faced criticism for giving Modi the official state visit treatment without putting a stronger focus on the rollback of press freedoms in India and his government's treatment of minority Muslims and Christians.

""The relationship must be grounded on a respect for pluralism, an open internet, human rights and liberal democracy,"" Khanna said.

Why it matters:Secretary Blinken visits Beijing as tensions grow between U.S. and China"
170,http://tehelka.com/modis-us-visit-a-heady-blend-of-statecraft-and-stagecraft/,Modi’s US visit: A heady blend of statecraft and stagecraft,,"Modi-Biden summit has scripted a new chapter in the relationship between the two countries, which, perhaps, will have worldwide impact on the geo-politics. But the meeting between the two leaders has fallen short of forging any formal security alliance, writes Gopal Misra

It was a rare blending of the statecraft with the stagecraft, mastered by the two leaders, US President Joe Biden and his official guest, Indian PM Narendra Modi. They scripted a new chapter in the relationship of their countries, which, perhaps, will have worldwide impact on the geo-politics.

Modi’s three-day action packed programme between June21-24 could have out shadowed any blockbuster either in Bollywood or Hollywood with its meticulous details, each scene loaded with well thought out ideas and weighed that how much it would be impacting the audience across the continents, and indeed on the law makers at Capitol, where the Indian PM was the first chief executive of his country to address the Congress second time- a rare honour extended to a world leader. Thus, he joins the elite club of the leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Winston Churchill. Earlier, they had addressed this powerful bicameral legislature, Senate, the Upper House and the Lower House of Representatives, and on the chair were Vice-President Kamala Harris and Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

There were joint communiqué and other statements; but the most significant event, perhaps, was when Modi’s nearly hour-long address to the US Congress which evoked multiple standing ovations, applauses and cheers from American lawmakers. Amidst the thunderous applause and clapping, he received a rousing reception as he walked up to the podium to deliver his address. The grand House Chamber at the US Capitol also echoed with the chants of ‘Modi, Modi’ from members of the Indian community sitting there. Earlier, Modi had addressed a joint meeting of the US Congress for the first time in 2016, but it was different this time. During the past seven years, the two countries have successfully evolved common perception on many key issues influencing the earth.

Modi’s address before the Congess that “any hesitation in India-US relations belongs to the past, emphasizing that the two democracies are currently at a critical juncture and that he is visiting the country to speak about the “calling for the century.” It means that the present 21st. century is the era of progress and cooperation that the relationship between the two countries is being founded for the coming decades.

Rahul’s visit no spanner in works

Just two weeks before Modi’s official visit to the USA, Rahul Gandhi, de-facto chief of the Indian National Congress, the party which had ruled India most of years since the departure of the British in 1947, presented his anti-Modi campaign in a most amicable way. Being under the spell of his political Guru, Sam Pitroda, admired for the telecommunication revolution in India, he was more amicable and accessible this time. Pitroda claims that he hails from a family of carpenters, claiming to be having a tag of the backward community, from Gujarat was seen telling Rahul, his disciple or “chela” to be more caste-focussed and speak for Muslims. However, he never tells that his wife is from a high-caste Brahmin community. It is difficult to assess, whether Rahul’s visit adversely affected the outcome of Modi’s visit, but it definitely emboldened Indian American Muslims to enlist support of as many as 75 lawmakers at the Capitol as well as statement from the former US president Barrack Obama.

Obama’s statement, issued during the summit, that India might be further split, if the minority rights are not ensured. He, perhaps, was responding to the resolution of the two lawmakers Rashida Talib and Juan Vargas urging the State Department to act on the recommendations of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and designate India as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act.

There was an intense campaign against Modi’s visit in New York, where posters were displayed on trucks asking “Hey Joe! Ask Modi why student activist Umar Khalid has been imprisoned for over 1000 days without trial?” Another poster drew the attention towards the ‘Lynching of Muslims, Christians and Dalits have surged under Modi’s rule,” The BBC documentary “India: The Modi Question” and the denial of a U.S. visa to Chief Minister Narendra Modi were the highlights of the anti-Modi campaign.

In a bid to counter the anti-Modi campaign, President Joe Biden and his administration appeared to be in full gear in defending Indian democracy. Both Modi and the US administration successfully turned the anti-Modi campaign as a part of “anti-India conspiracy”. On his part, Modi also presented himself in the best of his humour, when a journalist of an American channel asked him at the joint press-conference he had shared with Biden, about the plight of “minorities’ and the shrinking of “human rights” in India, and she also stated in a satirical tone that it is hoped that Modi would also hold press-conferences in his own country.

Indeed, it was Achilles heel for Modi, as during the past nine years since he is holding the country’s most important office, he did not hold any press-meet in New Delhi.

Before embarking on his official visit to Washington, Modi had stated that the two countries enjoy ‘trust’, and he reiterated in his address before the Congress that the mutual trust between the two democracies will enable us to explore new frontiers in science and space. Figuratively speaking, both Biden and Modi are determined to take the US-India relationship to new heights, even beyond moon and the unexplored space. During the summit, India and the US have committed themselves to work together in the exploration of the space, including frequent human visits to the moon and mars, and even exploring other planets.

Burying the Past

The India-US ties were always warm, if not intimate, except during President Richard Nixon’s administration in1971, when he had deployed his country’s warship equipped with nuclear devices in the Bay of Bengal to brow-beat India in support of the military rulers of Pakistan committing genocide of Muslims of the then East Pakistan, and the present Bangladesh. The White House archival details, now available in public domain, reveal that Nixon and his National Security Adviser (NSA), were not only abusive to the then Indian PM, Indira Gandhi, they also found themselves isolated within the adminsitraiton, when the American diplomats and media had rallied around opposing Nixon’s policies, which were favouring the genocide of Bengali Muslims in East Pakistan. During this period, Nixon had even asked China to invade India and warned USSR to face “consequences” if India is not restrained in supporting the uprising of Muslims in East Pakistan.

Even before Independence, the seeds of closer ties between the two countries were sown during the presidency of Roosevelt, who had been a consistent supporter of India’s independence and had even advised the then British leader and the war-time PM, Winston Churchill against India’s partition, but the British divided India on communal lines before leaving the country.

A Successful Visit

Modi’s three-day official visit to Washington is considered much more important than the earlier visits of his predecessors, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, P.V. Narsimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Dr. Manmohan Singh. During fifties and sixties, India-US relations could not blossom despite Nehru’s official visit to the USA. It was the period of cold war between the US-led western powers and the USSR’s Communist camp, and Nehru’s much-trumpeted non-aligned foreign policy was not acceptable to the Americans. They had continued to arm Pakistan with the state-of-the art weapons, which were later used against India. However, the relationship between the two countries started improving following the visit of P.V. Narsimha Rao to Washington, who had laid the foundation of opening of the Indian economy. It was the beginning of new India-US ties, which was continued during the regimes of Vajpayee and Dr. Singh.

It was the period, when the world witnessed a paradigm change in the world politics following the collapse of the USSR, and the emergence of the USA as the only Super Power on the earth. Three decades later, during the third decade of the 21st. century, China has emerged as a serious contender to replace America as a Super Power.

Blossoming of India-US Ties

Modi’s visit is just not limited to a security understanding or obtaining new generation weapon systems, but it paves the way for the blossoming of Indian genius with the American resources for better world order. In his address to the Congress, Modi told the law-makers that India has a huge pool of well-trained engineers and scientists, who could be contributing to the US-India joint ventures with their hard work blended with talent.

Earlier, Biden’s predecessors used to harbor ‘suspicion against Nehru’s non-aligned policies, but in contemporary America, the political leadership across the party lines consider the economic empowerment of the Global South is the only solution to contain China’s growing penetration across the continents.

Modi’s American visit has taken place, when Indian geniuses are transforming the country’s economy by blending knowledge with financial resources. In recent years, India has already achieved third position among the successful 108 unicorns. It may be noted that the new start-ups having a USD one billion investments are called unicorn. The Indians comprise a little more than the one third of the work force in the Silicon Valley, India is already technically advanced to receive and further develop technologies received from the USA. Therefore, the visit is being aptly described that “Modi’s time has come, when India’s time has also come”.

For many, it was a three-day show or “tamasha” of blending glamour and excitement from New York to Washington for Modi as well as for Biden, as both are going to face elections in 2024. Biden would be re-contesting for his second innings in the White House and Modi for his third –term.

Apart from joining the Yoga Day at the UN with famous film stars and celebrities, Modi met the scientists and investors, thus laying the foundation of a long-term multi-lateral cooperation with US academia, business and joint ventures in the frontier of science and technology.

US-India ties on the upswing

During the first quarter of the 21st. century, the successive US administrations, especially during the presidency of George W. Bush (2001-2009) and Barack Obama (2009-2017), have been accommodating to India’s core national interests and acknowledged outstanding concerns. During this period, there was a phenomenal increase in bilateral trade and investment, co-operation on global security issues. Before Modi’s official visit in 2023, the USA had been supporting India for admission to the Nuclear Suppliers Group and started joint-manufacturing through technology sharing arrangements. India was declared a Major US Defense Partner.

Both Biden and Modi are aspiring for yet another term for them in their respective high offices in the 2024 elections, when American would be electing a new President and In India, the Lok Sabha polls would be deciding the future of Modi and the ruling BJP.

There could be many reasons, which have finally led to the signing of ‘Critical Partnership’ in key areas, the first, that the Indian scientists and engineers have attained worldwide fame for their excellent performance in the frontiers of science research and technologies. It is often stated in America that it is easier to get admission to MIT, Harvard or any other Ivy League schools, viewed as some of the most prestigious universities in the world, than seeking admission to an IIT in India; secondly, Indians, who are trusted for their professional integrity occupy top positions in the American companies and universities, thirdly, India’s multi-party democracy has brought a stable system of governance for 140 billion people. The fourth reason, which is not being talked about is that despite grave provocations, India has been facing China with her own resources and defence capabilities.

Another reason which could have prompted the American establishment to have closer ties with India is that there are only two countries in Asia, India and Vietnam, who refused to be over-awed by the PLA. In February 1979, Vietnam had successfully repulsed the Chinese forces. One month later in March, China unilaterally withdrew its army. Earlier, during September 11-15, 1967 during the clashes at the Nathu La in Sikkim, Chinese casualties were estimated at 300 soldiers, while India had lost only 32 soldiers. The two countries do not subscribe to the much-trumpeted ‘invincibility’ of the Red Army.

Meanwhile interestingly, just 48 hours before Modi’s official visit to the US, the American Secretary of State Antony Blinken rushes to Beijing on June 19 ,where the Chinese President Xi Jinping welcomes the top U.S. diplomat at the Great Hall of the People, a grand venue usually reserved for greeting heads of state, and observed “progress” after shaking hands with his American guest.

Some key takeaways from PM visit

The US has decided to draw a bilateral roadmap for the next level of interoperability by sharing some critical and emerging technologies with India. The initiative signed on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) between India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and the US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has been furthered with INDUS-X during Modi’s visit. It will connect the national security innovation ecosystems of the two nations for research, development, and production of dual-use critical and emerging technologies.

Joint statement against terrorism

Biden and Modi not only condemn cross-border terrorism, they have also unveiled an extensive 58-point joint press statement , which commits for increasing trade and investment partnership as an “engine for global growth.” It envisages establishment of the interagency-led Strategic Trade Dialogue to explore avenues for enhancing high technology commerce and facilitating transfer of technology, which included the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on Semiconductor Supply Chain and Innovation Partnership. They have also decided to launch of two Joint Task Forces on advanced telecommunications, with a specific focus on research and development of technologies like Open RAN and 5G/6G and the joint Indo-U.S. Quantum Coordination Mechanism, which aims to foster collaboration among industry, academia, and government. These agreements also included the collaboration between General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for manufacturing of GE F-414 jet engines in India.

…………..

Ukraine no hurdle

The USA did not ask India to condemn Russia for the Ukraine war, but in the joint statement, both leaders expressed deep concern over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and mourned the humanitarian loss and emphasized the need for a peaceful resolution.

More muscle for Quad

Both Biden and Modi have decided for further strengthen the Quad as a partnership for global good. They emphasized the significance of a “rules-based international order. In West Asia, they decided to further the partnership between the I2U2 countries (India, Israel, United Arab Emirates and the United States)."

December 1st, 2022 is a momentous day as India assumed the presidency of the G20 forum, taking over from Indonesia. As the largest democracy in the world, and the fastest growing economy, India’s G20 presidency will play a crucial role in building upon the significant achievements of the previous 17 presidencies.

As it takes the G20 Presidency, India is on a mission to bring about a shared global future for all through the Amrit Kaal initiative with a focus on the LiFE movement which aims to promote environmentally-conscious practices and a sustainable way of living. With a clear plan and a development-oriented approach, India aims to promote a rules-based order, peace and just growth for all. The 200+ events planned in the run up to the 2023 Summit will strengthen India’s agenda and the six thematic priorities of India’s G20 presidency.

The G20 group of 19 countries and the EU was established in 1999 as a platform for Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to discuss international economic and financial issues. Together, the G20 countries account for almost two-thirds of the global population, 75% of global trade, and 85% of the world's GDP. In the wake of the global financial and economic crisis of 2007, the G20 was elevated to the level of Heads of State/Government and was named the ""premier forum for international economic cooperation.""

The G20 has two main tracks of engagement: the Finance Track for finance ministers and central bank governors and the Sherpa Track. The G20's proceedings are led by the Sherpas, who are appointed as personal envoys of the leaders of member nations.These Sherpas are responsible for overseeing the negotiations that occur throughout the year, deliberating on the agenda for the summit and coordinating the substantive work of the G20. Both tracks have working groups to address specific themes with representatives from relevant parties.

Working groups this year will focus on global priority areas such as green development, climate finance, inclusive growth, digital economy, public infrastructure, technology transformation, and reforms for women empowerment for socio-economic progress. All these steps are taken to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and secure a better future for the generations to come.

India’s G20 Presidency:

India will convene the G20 Leaders' Summit for the first time in 2023, as 43 Heads of Delegations- the largest ever in the G20–will participate in the final New Delhi Summit in September later this year. As a nation committed to democracy and multilateralism, India's presidency will be a significant milestone as it seeks to find practical global solutions for the benefit of all and embody the idea of ""Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" or ""the world is one family.""

The G20 Summit is held annually with a rotating presidency, and in 2023, India will hold the presidency. The group does not have a permanent secretariat and is supported by the previous, current, and future holders of the presidency, known as the troika. In 2023, the troika consists of Indonesia, Brazil, and India.

This summit will conclude a series of meetings throughout the year, with potential host cities for meetings from December 2022 to February 2023 including Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Chennai, Guwahati, Indore, Jodhpur, Khajuraho, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Pune, Rann of Kutch, Surat, Thiruvananthapuram, and Udaipur.

Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which translates to ""One Earth, One Family, One Future,"" is the theme of India's G20 presidency. It is inspired from the Maha Upanishad, an old Sanskrit scripture. The theme fundamentally highlights the importance of all life—human, animal, plant, and microorganism—as well as their interdependence on Earth and across the universe. The theme also exemplifies LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment), which highlights the importance of environmentally sustainable and responsible lifestyle choices, both at the individual and national level, in creating a cleaner, greener, and bluer future.

The G20 Presidency also heralds for India the start of ""Amritkaal,"" a 25-year period commencing from the 75th anniversary of its independence on August 15, 2022, leading up to the centenary of its independence

India's G20 Priorities:

1. Green Development, Climate Finance & LiFE

India's focus on climate change, with a particular emphasis on climate finance and technology, as well as ensuring just energy transitions for developing countries.

Introduction of the LiFE movement, which promotes environmentally-conscious practices and is based on India's sustainable traditions.

2. Accelerated, Inclusive & Resilient Growth

Focus on areas that have the potential to bring structural transformation, including supporting small and medium-sized enterprises in global trade, promoting labour rights and welfare, addressing the global skills gap, and building inclusive agricultural value chains and food systems.

3. Accelerating Progress on SDGs

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with their Indian counterparts in New Delhi as part of an Asian trip aimed at showing unity over Russia’s war in Ukraine and preventing differences on the Israel-Hamas war from deepening.

Blinken said the U.S. and India were continuing to “deepen our collaboration on everything from emerging technologies to defense to people-to-people ties” and align diplomacy for “an Indo-Pacific region that’s free, that’s open, that’s prosperous, that’s resilient.”

He said the two sides discussed the crisis in the Middle East and “we appreciate the fact that from day one India has strongly condemned the attacks of Oct. 7. And as our joint statement makes clear, India and the United States stand with Israel against terrorists.”

Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said the situation in the Middle East was a big concern. While India has condemned the Hamas attack on Israel, it balances its position by calling for talks on “a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine living within secure and recognized borders, side-by-side at peace with Israel.”

Blinken met with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and “reaffirmed their shared vision for close partnership in the Indo-Pacific,” said U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.

“They emphasized working together to address ongoing crises such as Russia’s war against Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East,” Miller said.

Vinay Mohan Kwatra, India’s top bureaucrat in the foreign ministry, said India’s tense ties with China also were discussed at the official-level talks, but declined to give details.

​India’s relationship with China has deteriorated since 2020, when Indian and Chinese troops clashed along their disputed border in the Himalayan Ladakh region, leaving 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead. A standoff involving thousands of soldiers in the eastern Ladakh region continues, despite several rounds of military and diplomatic talks.

Blinken said he also discussed with the Indian side a diplomatic dispute that erupted when Canada alleged that India was involved in the assassination of a Sikh separatist in Canada.

Blinken said that the U.S. wants the two sides to resolve their differences in a cooperative way and urged India to “work with Canada on its investigation.”

The dispute started when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were “credible allegations” of Indian involvement in the killing of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar in suburban Vancouver in western Canada. India rejected the accusation.

India and the U.S. have held so-called two-plus-two talks between India’s external affairs and defense ministers and the U.S. secretaries of state and defense since 2018 to discuss issues of concern and strengthen bilateral ties.

Austin and his Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh, discussed a roadmap for defense industrial cooperation that will fast-track technology cooperation and co-production of defense systems, India’s defense ministry said.

“We’re integrating our industrial bases, strengthening our inter-operability, and sharing cutting-edge technology,” Austin said in his opening remarks.

Washington expects India to be a leading security provider in the Indo-Pacific region.

During Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States in June, the two sides adopted a policy guide for defense industries to enable them to produce advanced defense systems together and collaborate on research and testing of prototypes.

The two sides reached an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.

A joint statement at the conclusion of Blinken and Austin’s visit to New Delhi on Friday said the two sides reaffirmed their roadmap for defense industrial cooperation to strengthen India’s capabilities, enhance its defense production, facilitate technology-sharing, and promote supply chain resilience.

With a population of more than 1.4 billion, India is the world’s largest democracy. Over the past decade, the country’s integration into the global economy has been accompanied by economic growth. India has now emerged as a global player."
182,https://thediplomat.com/2014/10/what-did-narendra-modis-us-trip-accomplish/,What Did Narendra Modi’s US Trip Accomplish?,,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi just completed his much anticipated trip to the United States, returning to Delhi after a five day visit to New York and Washington, D.C. The enthusiasm, coverage, and according to some, hype, that Modi’s trip to the U.S. generated was enormous. Regardless of the actual policy accomplishments of Modi’s trip, many will regard it as a success. As many recent incidents and events have shown, Indians, especially the middle-class Indians who are most likely to influence public opinion, are prickly about India’s honor and pride. They want a leader who is seen as being a proactive advocate of India and is heard and respected by the international community and world powers. In other words, they want a leader who can generate buzz, and Modi accomplishes this.

Marketing

Of course, it would be problematic if Modi’s government only aimed to generate buzz for the sake of buzz. But this does not seem to be the case, as Modi and people around Modi have been fairly clear on their foreign policy, economic, and development vision. In speech after speech, a clear ideology that we can call “Modism” or “Moditva” has emerged, a vision that seeks a strong and proactive role for India that includes being heard at international forums, reaching out to non-resident Indians, and courting investment. Modi worked toward all these goals during his visit to the United States. To reach these goals, a certain amount of marketing is necessary. Modi is a master at marketing and India is in dire need of marketing.

Marketing is important because it generates the conditions and circumstances that lead to actual policy triumphs. For example, for investment in India to increase, not only does India need to change its policies, but it needs to convince foreign companies to invest in India. Much of Modi’s actions since his election and in the U.S. were a form of marketing aimed at both an international and domestic audience. This is especially important in the Indian context because Modi needs to convince a domestic audience with many skeptics that India needs a drastic change in its approach to key areas, especially after decades of doing things another way. Even if India’s old policies were not working well, it is hard to shake a bureaucratic system from decades of complacency and habit. Modi’s task is not too dissimilar to Deng Xiaoping’s in the first few years after 1978: he must insistently build a new consensus drastically different than the old one in his country.

India has also been poorly marketed on the international arena by the Indian government in the past. Despite its large size and demand for clout, it has frequently been ignored and not sought out on major international issues. Unlike Russian or Chinese leaders, its leaders have not acted like international statesmen in recent times. India developed an unfriendly reputation as a destination for international investment and is widely written off by foreign companies. Domestically, India’s image has largely been shaped by the Western media, which tends to glorify or disparage its poverty. Media coverage of social problems, like caste and rape, have further hurt India’s image. In short, India has failed to portray itself as an attractive country in multiple realms. Of course, marketing alone won’t change this, but marketing goes hand in hand with policy improvements.

It thus has become necessary for India to rebrand itself. Cynics will of course argue that this is propaganda. But propaganda creates an image that is not in accordance with reality while marketing simply advertises, reinforces, and places a positive spin on existing facts. And since there are hardly any neutral facts in the media age, virtually all forms of news, advertisement, marketing, and imagery put some sort of spin or the other on facts. It is beneficial for any country to generate a positive rather than a negative spin to its facts.

Policy Accomplishments

Therefore, marketing India was indeed a major accomplishment of Modi’s visit. It is a necessary course of action for a country like India that wishes to be taken seriously as a major world and economic power. India will need to continue to consciously market itself far into the future to continuously make itself attractive to tourists, business, and other countries. Beyond marketing, however, Modi’s visit did accomplish some interesting and practical goals.

In a major foreign policy shift for the Indian government, Modi met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday night in New York, the first bilateral meeting between Israeli and Indian leaders in over a decade. The two leaders are reported to have gotten along well and are laying the groundwork for closer ties between their countries. India has traditionally supported the Palestinian cause in the name of anti-colonial solidarity, but there is really no point in doing so anymore. On the other hand, India and Israel have a number of mutual strategic interests, namely fighting radical Islamism in the region between them. Netanyahu invited Modi to Israel for a state visit. It would be interesting and indeed groundbreaking if Modi did make an official trip to Jerusalem.

Also in New York, Modi announced new visa and travel schemes that will make it easier for people to get to India. This in turn will help business and people to people connections. “People of Indian Origin” (PIO) cardholders will now be able to get lifelong visas for travel to India. Previously, this option had only been open to those of Indian origin who had applied to another scheme, called the Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI). Modi’s plan thus eliminates tiers in India’s policies towards overseas Indians. Additionally, U.S. tourists will be able to get electronic travel authorizations and visas on arrival in India.

In New York, Modi also met with business leaders and urged them to invest in India. He elaborated on policies he would implement to facilitate investment in India later during his trip in Washington D.C. at a speech at the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC). Modi’s remarks were well-received by USIBC and American government and business leaders, as Modi said that “today, I can say with confidence that within six months, we will implement and enforce all parameters of ease of business.” Modi argued that India’s failure to live up to its potential before was due to the fact that India did not make beneficial policy decisions and that the solution to India’s problems was mostly a matter of getting a move on things such as policy changes.

Modi expressed a desire to liberalize India’s economy during his speech at USIBC, arguing that India’s government’s job “is to facilitate things and not run a business.” Modi also added that “the less the regulations and law, the more fresh air” and “there should be no existence of tax terrorism. There should be a simplification of taxation system.” Expressing a strong belief in India’s future prospects, Modi urged American businesses to invest in India before the queue became too long.

Finally, Modi met with American political leaders including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Secretary of State John Kerry. Although these meetings were mostly heavier on rhetoric than policy, they still set the stage for future policies as well as allowing President Obama the chance to get to know Modi. At the very least, Obama and Modi got along and are willing to work together towards common goals, as their co-authored editorial in the Washington Post declares. Though vague and filled with platitudes, the editorial nonetheless suggests several areas where India and the United States could cooperate on concretely in the future. However, the main thrust of Modi’s visit to the United States was to discuss business and investment (Modi’s top priority) rather than to make political deals."

A joint statement at the conclusion of Blinken and Austin’s visit to New Delhi on Friday said the two sides reaffirmed their roadmap for defense industrial cooperation to strengthen India’s capabilities, enhance its defense production, facilitate technology-sharing, and promote supply chain resilience.

From leading a record-breaking yoga event at the United Nations to forging important defence and semiconductor production deals, PM Modi's trip showcased India's cultural heritage, diplomatic prowess, and its growing influence on the world stage.

There are five important takeaways from PM Modi’s US visit that one can immediately think of, besides tons of memorable moments and gestures that will remain etched in the evolving timeline of the friendship between the two nations.

Manifesting India's cultural and spiritual leadership

PM Modi leading 177 nations in performing yoga at the United Nations on International Yoga Diwas was a historic moment, reminiscent of Swami Vivekananda's impactful speech at the World Congress of Religions in 1893. By spearheading the global embrace of India's ancient science, yoga, PM Modi not only demonstrated the country's cultural and spiritual leadership but also reinforced the concept of India as a ""spiritual democracy"". This concept encompasses the country's rich spiritual heritage, where diverse religious and philosophical beliefs coexist harmoniously within a democratic framework and without any discrimination.

The event not only showcased the physical and mental benefits of yoga but also highlighted India's commitment to promoting holistic well-being and inner harmony. By engaging a record number of nations in this practice, PM Modi underscored India's potential to serve as a guiding light for spiritual enlightenment and self-discovery in a world grappling with various challenges.

Countering toxic rhetoric and fostering unity

During his visit, PM Modi effectively dismantled the toxic rhetoric that democracy is in danger and that Muslims are unsafe in India. In his eloquent speech to the Senate, he emphasised India's longstanding commitment to democratic values and inclusivity. His words resonated with the audience, receiving 15 standing ovations, even from individuals with differing political ideologies. By highlighting India's pluralistic society and its respect for the rights and safety of all citizens, regardless of their religious or cultural background, PM Modi showcased India's strength as a nation that upholds the principles of democracy and fosters unity in diversity.

Strengthening defence and semiconductor production deals

The most significant economic achievements of PM Modi's visit were the strategic defence and semiconductor production deals signed between India and the US. These agreements not only enhance India's defence capabilities but also solidify its position as a reliable partner for advanced technology collaborations. The defence partnership aims to bolster India's security infrastructure and foster stronger military ties with the US. This cooperation reflects the growing trust and mutual interests shared by the two nations in maintaining regional stability and countering common security challenges.

Furthermore, the semiconductor production deals signify India's aspirations to become a global manufacturing hub for advanced technologies. By attracting investments and establishing semiconductor manufacturing units, India aims to reduce its dependence on imports and contribute to the global supply chain. These agreements align with PM Modi's vision of fostering innovation and technological advancement in India, thereby boosting economic growth and creating employment opportunities.

Moving beyond China and asserting regional dominance

US President Joe Biden's bold stance against the Chinese establishment, labelling it as a dictatorship, signifies the strengthening Indo-US axis. The increased strategic engagement between India and the US indicates a shared objective to diminish China's influence in the region and establish dominance in the Indian Ocean. This collaborative approach between the two nations aims to ensure peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, thereby positioning India as a key player in shaping the region's future.

India's strategic location and its growing economic and military capabilities make it an important partner for the US in maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. The focus on regional cooperation and security aligns with India's ‘Act East’ policy.

US knows Modi will be back in 2024

Finally, why would the US invest so lavishly in India when general elections are just a few months away? That’s because the US, through its multiple intelligence sources, is convinced PM Modi will retain the PM’s post handsomely.

India, with its age-old virtuous concepts of Ram Rajya and Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, was always supposed to be the world’s biggest spiritual democracy, which it is now seen as. Its population of 140 crore is the country’s biggest capital. India, in 2047, will be in a different league, thanks to the unprecedented growth impetus generated by PM Modi.

Women empowerment

“Today, in modern India, women are leading us to a better future. India’s vision is not just of development which benefits women, it’s of women-led development where women lead the journey of progress.”"

Elected representatives and government officials

Leaders from academia

Community leaders and prominent Indian Americans from different sectors

A significant takeaway from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent state visit to the US was the prominent role that Indian Americans are increasingly being seen in. From US Congress and the White House to CEOs of top MNCs, prominent lawyers, doctors and academicians; the PM’s visit turned the spotlight on many of them and highlighted their success stories.“The Indian diaspora has been the consistent glue over decades for the relationship between our two countries, and today, Indian-Americans are creating tremendous positive impact in American society, as was noted by President Biden and Prime Minister Modi. The Indian community's voice is growing louder and clearer every day in the highest echelons of power,” feels Sanjeev Joshipura, Washington DC based executive director of Indiaspora, a non-profit organisation of global Indian origin leaders.He adds that now more than ever before, the Indian diaspora in the United States is getting acknowledged for positive contributions to American life and US-India relations in areas of business, medicine, entrepreneurship, technology, academics, law, politics, philanthropy, media, cuisine, arts and culture, and other myriad realms of activity.Several members of Indiaspora participated in various events during Prime Minister Modi's historic visit to the US. On behalf of Indiaspora, its founder MR Rangaswami and his wife, Krisanthy Desby, attended the White House state dinner and the state department lunch. Many other members of the organisation, too, enjoyed visibility during PM Modi ’s visit.The official events attended by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Indian American CEOs, prominent personalities from the world of fashion, entertainment and media; US representatives from Washington DC, key members of the Biden-Harris administration and other well-known figures from medicine, academia, law and social impact showcased the strengthening of the status of Indian Americans.Shekar Narasimhan, chairman, AAPI Victory Fund, a political action committee that mobilises the Asian American community, who attended the state dinner hosted for PM Modi by US President Joe Biden at the White House and the state department luncheon; found several moments during the high-profile events which celebrated Indian Americans. The most significant moment for him was secretary of state Antony Blinken giving a shout-out to Rich Verma, first Indian origin US Ambassador to India and now the highest-ranking Indian American in the state department’s history, as the son of a teacher from Jalandhar.Dr Sampat Shivangi, a physician and an influential Indian American community leader, who was at the state department luncheon feels that Indian Americans showed unprecedented support to the US-India relationship with their presence in thousands at the White House lawns despite inclement weather. “This show of strength and support by the diaspora highlights the phenomenal transformation in the relationship between the two greatest democracies of our times,” he said.Prime Minister Modi who wrapped up his US visit with an event with the diaspora, is very popular with the community with hundreds turning up to hear him speak in Washington DC and over 300 working as volunteers at the event. “Members of the Indian community form 1.5% of the US population but have now become influential financial contributors to the campaigns of Congress members and Senators. It’s not just in Chicago, New York or California areas; the community is perceived as being highly educated and making a positive impact socially across America,” says Dr Bharat Barai, an oncologist and a community leader from Chicago, who was at the White House dinner and the community event. He adds that members of the Indian American community are usually the biggest advocates for India and issues that are important for the Indo-US relationship in the US.Prominent Indian Americans who met Prime Minister Modi during his recent state visit to the US.Revathi Advaithi, CEO, FlexJeevan Mulgund, founder, The Abe Collective LLCBela Bajaria, chief content officer of NetflixManesh Chandwani, CEO, Superior BiologicsJay Chaudhry, CEO, ZScalerFrank Islam, entrepreneur, investor and philanthropistSanjay Govil, owner of the Washington Freedom, part of Major League Cricket in the USPalash Gupta, Chairman of Delaware Asian American Business AssociationVimal Kapur, CEO, HoneywellRajesh Subramaniam, CEO, FedExPunit Renjen, Deputy Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, SAPDeepak Raj, investor and philanthropistSanjay Ramabhadran, founding principal, Versa InfrastructureSunil Wadhwani, entrepreneur and investorSmita N.

Clearly, what he was highlighting was the need for the international community to recognize that the people who sponsor terrorism, support terrorism, they continue to pose a serious challenge to the safety and security of our societies and have to be very sternly and firmly dealt with

When the Prime Minister and the President held their discussions all aspects of such global challenges were discussed between the two and how India and US could cooperate to mitigate, address, try and deal with this challenge as comprehensively as possible that was also discussed between the two leaders.

And going forward, it would be our effort to see how some of those discussions can translate into concrete. Cooperative decision between India and the US

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet President Joe Biden on Thursday during his first state visit to the U.S. High on the agenda will be deepening of defense ties, partnerships in technology and India's role in the Indo-Pacific. Ties between India and the U.S. are at a turning point and the relationship between the two nations have improved in the last decade, said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at Observer Research Foundation, a Delhi-based think tank. ""This is a very important visit, it is as much about India reaching out to the U.S., as it is about the U.S. reaching out to India,"" Pant said. Biden has only hosted two state visits during his presidency, the first with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in December 2022, and the second with South Korea's president Yoon Suk Yeol in April. ""This visit symbolizes the unwavering commitment to deepening ties and signifies the immense potential for both countries to collaborate amidst global challenges,"" Farwa Aamer the director of South Asia initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said. ""For many in India and the U.S., the visit is a testament to the promise and high expectations for the future of U.S.-India collaboration — one of shared prosperity,"" Aamer said. The U.S. is looking at India as a partner it can rely on, but its partnership will be very different since India is not an ally, Pant told CNBC. ""The U.S. is not used to having partners that are not allies, but is willing to look at its partnership with India differently — one that is relatively independent minded but will help American priorities as well,"" he said in a phone interview.

Strengthening defense ties

India and Russia have long shared a steadfast relationship, with India relying heavily on the Kremlin for oil and military weapons. The South Asian nation is the world's largest buyer of Russian arms, accounting for approximately 20% of Russia's current order, Reuters reported. ""India has been too dependent on one country and that is not good, and although dependence has dropped from 80% in the 1990s to about 65% now, dependence is still huge,"" Pant pointed out. However, because of the war in Ukraine, Russia has not been able to send critical defense weapons it had promised India, pushing the Indian military to look to others — such as the U.S. — for supplies.

Still, analysts are optimistic that the meeting between Biden and Modi could lead to more weapons agreements. India has long been interested in buying SeaGuardian drones from the U.S., but the hoped-for deal that could be worth between $2 billion to $3 billion has been long hampered by ""bureaucratic stumbling blocks,"" Reuters reported. The deal could still be brought back to the table. ""India's Ministry of Defense has reportedly approved the purchase so it seems likely. The U.S. would like this to go through,"" Manjari Miller, senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations told CNBC. ""It would be important for the partnership — only a few military allies and NATO countries have this drone, and the U.S. is particular about whom it sells U.S. weapons and technology to."" She highlighted that now is an important time for the deal to come through as it will draw ""India closer into the U.S. defense orbit, and is a step away from India's dependence on Russian arms and equipment."" India is undermining its strategic options by thinking it can continue to rely on Russia, Lisa Curtis, senior fellow and director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. ""It wants to try to keep a wedge between Russia and China because it doesn't want to contemplate the idea of Russia and China both arrayed against it. Then you throw Pakistan in there and things look really dire from the Indian perspective,"" Curtis told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The drones will also enhance the Indian armed forces ""intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance capabilities"" that will aid the country in securing their borders with China and Pakistan, Karthik Nachiappan, research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore said. Tensions between India and China over the disputed border in the Himalayan region has been ongoing since the 1950s with no end in sight. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in June 2020 in hand-to-hand combat with Chinese troops, followed by another clash in December 2022. But India wants to ""go beyond a buyer-seller relationship,"" with the U.S., Pant said adding that India is working toward a ""co-production and co-development relationship"" with the U.S. so it can build its own domestic manufacturing defense base. Private sectors in the U.S. could also start making more significant investments in India, with the two countries set to work together on producing fighter jet engines, said Pant. ""There's a change in the way the U.S. looks at India, and defense will be a beneficiary of that. India will definitely be looking to reduce its dependence on Russia, and that will be quite an extreme move,"" he added. Without mentioning China, the White House said in May the visit will ""strengthen our two countries' shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space."" ""Both the United States and India share the objective of not having an Asia that is dominated by China, or an Indo-Pacific region that is subject to Chinese coercion and assertiveness,"" said Ashley Tellis, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in a Q&A report.

Energy: Reliance on Russian oil

Although India's purchase of Russian weapons could fall, the same can't be said for oil. When Western nations imposed sanctions on Russian oil as a result of the unprovoked war in Ukraine, India doubled down on its purchases. Russian oil currently accounts for almost 20% of India's annual crude imports, a significant increase from just 2% in 2021, Reuters reported. Oil prices were extremely volatile at the start of the Ukraine war in February last year, spiking to $100 for the first time since 2014 . But India has continued to buy cheap Russian oil since and continues trading with the country despite global sanctions on the Kremlin.

""India has become very close to the West in the last five to 10 years, but it understands that it cannot simply detach from Russia,"" Amit Ranjan, research fellow at the NUS Institute of South Asian Studies said. ""Russia is an old friend of India, and India understands the importance of the relationship … Oil is an important piece of that relationship,"" Ranjan said.

Technology: Diversifying from China

Partnerships in technology will be also be top on the agenda for Modi. ""I think the technology issues have become so critically important, as we see China making advancements and hear about China's advancements with AI,"" according to Curtis. ""In seeing how much China is advancing, the U.S. now understands the importance of really cooperating closely with India and trying to take advantage of the strengths on both sides,"" she said. ""There are so many ways that the two sides can benefit from this increased technology cooperation—not to mention the progress that has been made on semiconductors. This has been a real area of focus for India and the United States, and I see that only growing as we move into the future,"" Curtis added. There will also be a flurry of business meetings with tech leaders. Tesla chief Elon Musk met Modi in New York to discuss the EV company's ambitions in India and the possibility of setting up a manufacturing facilities in the country. Modi is also expected to meet other CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft's Satya Nadella and FedEx's Raj Subramaniam at the White House state dinner on Thursday, sources told CNBC. The growing partnership between India and the U.S. also gives room for the two nations to adopt a ""China plus one"" strategy and push more technology companies to set up operations in India, analysts told CNBC. The U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology was announced in May last year. The iCET initiative aims to ""elevate and expand"" the two countries' technology partnership and defense industrial cooperation, the White House said in January. Pant said it points to the two countries' willingness to work together — both in terms of research and development, and what both governments can do together. In the last six months, more U.S. technology companies have set their eyes on India."

210,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/modis-white-house-visit-highlights-deep-diaspora-divides-rcna89275,Modi’s White House visit highlights deep diaspora divides,,"Many South Asian Americans have mixed feelings as they prepare themselves for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to the White House this week.

As some get ready to gather in Washington, D.C., both to welcome and protest him, data from a 2021 study underscores just how torn the diaspora is when it comes to the controversial leader — and it shows that his popularity among Indian Americans falls short of how he is received in India.

This week marks Modi’s first official state visit to the U.S., which had not invited an Indian prime minister since 2009. Modi was once banned from the U.S. for the role he allegedly played in the deadly Gujarat riots, in which 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, were killed.

For many community leaders, a historic moment is severely marred by that and other aspects of Modi’s human rights record, including censoring journalists and stripping autonomy from the region of Kashmir.

“For this kind of a ruler to be invited to a state dinner by an American president and to be given an opportunity to speak to a joint session of Congress, where he’s going to talk about the ideals of democracy, is just mind-boggling,” said Ajit Sahi, the advocacy director for the Indian American Muslim Council.

The study, conducted by the Carnegie Endowment, found that Modi’s approval rating is much lower among Indian Americans (50%) than among Indians living in India (77%). Dozens of lawmakers in both houses of Congress signed a letter urging President Joe Biden to address human rights concerns with Modi during his visit.

“This is an important relationship that we need to continue and build on as it relates to human rights,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a briefing last month.

Sahi said that though Hindu nationalist sentiment in diaspora communities cannot be ignored, he thinks college-educated young people who grew up in the U.S. are distancing themselves from Modi’s politics.

“The American values of liberalism, progressivism, equality for all, justice for all, equality before the law, I think these are the things that more or less get deeply rooted in the psyche, especially if you were born and raised here,” he said.

But the diaspora in the U.S. is still split down the middle in terms of support for Modi. According to the study, 49% of Indian Americans rate his performance favorably, either strongly approving or approving of him; 31% disapprove of his performance; and 20% expressed no opinion on him at all.

“It’s a polarized space,” said Sunita Viswanath, a co-founder of the civil rights group Hindus for Human Rights. “There’s very little scope for bridge-building. ... On the one hand, you have this mainstream Hindu response, which is that India’s national leader is coming to town and is being greeted by the American president with a state dinner, and that puts India on the map.”

On the other hand, those in minority religions and castes oppressed in India say the visit feels as though the U.S. is validating the structural bias their families face, Viswanath said. Many in diaspora spaces say that bias has followed them.

“Inclusive secular democracy means the right for all the different religions to exist and practice freely,” she said. “We are Hindus, we are proud Hindus, but our Hinduism and our devotion to secular democracy, whether it’s in America, where most of us live, or in India, where most of us are from, that is what is motivating us.”

As South Asians in both camps plan to assemble in Washington throughout Modi’s three-day visit, some national organizations are urging Biden to address his recent actions.

The Committee to Protect Journalists issued a statement last week denouncing Modi’s media crackdown and the arrests of journalists since he came to power in 2014.

“Journalists critical of the government and the BJP party have been jailed, harassed, and surveilled in retaliation for their work,” CPJ President Jodie Ginsberg said in the statement. “India is the world’s largest democracy, and it needs to live up to that by ensuring a free and independent media — and we expect the United States to make this a core element of discussions.”

The Hindu American Foundation declined to comment on Modi’s visit. Overseas Friends of the BJP, an international arm of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, did not respond to requests for comment.

The Council on American Islamic Relations released a video and a petition opposing Modi’s visit to address a joint session of Congress on Thursday because of his anti-Muslim, anti-Dalit and anti-Sikh policies.

“The evidence of Modi’s expanding effort to place a boot firmly on the collective heads of India’s religious minorities is extensive,” the petition said.

Though it’s hard to predict how many Indian Americans will gather outside the White House, Modi’s 2019 trip to the U.S. drew over 50,000 to Houston for a rally called “Howdy Modi.” President Donald Trump co-hosted the event, calling it a “profoundly historic event.”

Viswanath remembers the experience four years ago, protesting outside the stadium as fellow Indian Americans poured inside.

“I was holding my sign, and people were streaming into the stadium dressed in their finest,” she said. “They looked like me. They looked like my family. It was one of those moments where I’m grateful I’m on this side of history. … Our deep hope, our ardent hope, is that as we build this space, Hindus will join us.”"

Nine years later, the prime minister did the same when he addressed a select crowd of Indian-Americans at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, DC.

The last engagement before he ended his state visit to the United States and flew off to Egypt, PM Modi addressed the Indian diaspora at an event organised by the United States Indian Community Foundation during which chants of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and ‘Vande Mataram’ reverberated loudly.

After his address, US Congressman Shri Thanedar, he also escorted PM Modi to the US Congress for his address, said: “Very exciting. I have never seen this king of enthusiasm for any visiting prime minister. I am very proud of PM Modi. He is enormously popular. I am looking forward to working with him to broaden and deepen our relationship.”

PM Modi had earlier arrived in the US on 21 June for his maiden state visit on the invitation of US president Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. His visit has gone beyond mere optics – the two countries, India and the US, have signed important deals in the sectors of trade, defence, technology and space.

Here are the big talking points from Modi’s diaspora event.

Growing Indo-US ties

PM Modi’s speech to the Indian diaspora focused on the growing partnership between the two countries – India and the US. At the start of his speech, Modi told the audience, “In a way, you have charted out the full map of India in this hall. I can see people from all corners of India here. It seems that a mini India has turned up. I have received unprecedented love and affection during my stay in the US.”

He added, “I want to thank you all for showing such a beautiful image of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat’, in America.”

Modi credited US president Joe Biden for furthering ties between the two nations, calling him ‘a sorted and experienced leader. He stated that Biden had personally put in a lot of effort to take India-US ties to new heights. “Be it defence, industry, manufacturing, or the industrial supply chain, we are heading towards a better future together,” said the PM.

He added that the decision of General Electric Company to manufacture fighter plane engines in India will prove to be a milestone for India’s defence sector. He further added that other companies like Google, Micron, Applies Materials had also, during his visit, announced to make investments in India, which would help create employment in India.

Prime Minister Modi stated that India-US ties would also go beyond land and extend into the skies after India signed the Artemis Accord. “This will provide several opportunities in space research. With NASA, India will send astronauts to space. That is why I said ‘Sky is not the limit’.”

Modi asserted that the full potential of partnership between the two countries is yet to be realised and their ties is all about making the world better again in the 21st Century.

How PM Modi’s visit to the US is sparking a wave of investments

H1-B visa and new consulates

Maybe one of the most important talking points from Modi’s diaspora event was that of the changes being introduced in the H1-B visa process.

Addressing the diaspora, PM Modi said: “Indian-Americans will not have to travel outside India to renew their H1B visas.”

For the unaware, the H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations – such as technology, finance, engineering, and architecture – which require theoretical or technical expertise. America hires thousands of Indians through the H1-B visa.

Since 2004, those on an H1-B visa had to return to India to renew these visas and get the H-1B extension stamped on their passport. This had become a big inconvenience for foreign guest workers and also for their employees, especially as the visa wait time is more than 800 days or more than two years.

However, Modi’s announcement will bring relief to Indians on H-1B visas, who will now be able to renew those visas within the country, without having to travel abroad.

Besides the visa, Modi also announced a new Indian consulate would be opened in Seattle this year, with two more in other US cities. Additionally, America’s new consulates would be opened in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad.

Invest in ‘transformed’ India

Prime Minister Modi also pitched the idea of a new, transformed India to the audience at the event. He told the crowd, “The manner in which India has seen a digital revolution in the past few years is unprecedented. Maybe you will see a barcode board there at a shop in your village. Maybe you try to pay in cash and the shopkeeper asks if you have a digital payment app on your phone. This transformed India will amaze you. Today anyone, anywhere in India can do 24/7 banking. Be it Sunday or Monday, there is no impact on it.”

He attributed this ‘tremendous progress’ to the belief of 140 crore people in the country. “Hundreds of years of colonisation had taken this belief away from us,” he added.

He stated that “New India knows its direction and has no confusion about its decisions, resolve. Its potential turning into performance.”

Amid chants of ‘Modi, Modi’, the prime minister also said that there was no better time but the present to invest in India. “This is the best time to invest as much as possible in India. Many of you have been living here for years. But I know your hearts are back in India.”

Antiquities to be returned

Another interesting point that PM Modi raised during his speech to the Indian diaspora at the Ronald Reagan Building was that about 100 ancient artefacts stolen from India will be returned by the American government.

“These antiques were taken away both in the wrong and right ways, and found their way into foreign markets. I thank the US government for returning these. This symbolises that we respect each others’ emotions as countries. This shows that India-US relations are strengthening not just businesswise, but also sentimentally,” the PM said.

Since coming to power, Modi’s government has untiring worked to restore and preserve India’s cultural heritage by getting all stone artefacts back to their rightful place.

Even during his 2021 US visit, the PM had brought home 157 artefacts and antiquities, which included items ranging from 1.5 metre bas relief panel of Revanta in sandstone from 10th CE, to the 8.5 cm tall, exquisite bronze Nataraja from the 12th CE.

At the conclusion of his address, PM Modi said amid a thunderous applause and a roaring crowd – “Together we are not just forming policies and agreements, we are shaping lives, dreams and destinies.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s grand welcome at the White House by US President Joe Biden, First Lady Jill Biden and massive fanfare gave a bold picture of how strong the ties between United States and India are in the 21st century.

PM Modi and POTUS Joe Biden shared a warm embrace right outside the White House, displaying to the world the deep friendship between the two nations. The welcome received by PM Modi at the White House was nothing short of extravagant and made headlines across the world.

Indo-US ties on Thursday appeared to be on the cusp of an upward leap as President Joe Biden described them as one of the most defining relationships in the 21st century while Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that the US leader's commitment to their bond has inspired his country to take ""bold and audacious"" steps.

PM Modi’s grand welcome to Washington kicked off with a massive crown of Indian Americans chanting his name, and acapella group Penn Masala performing the iconic song ‘Chaiyya Chaiyya’ at the White House.

The Indian prime minister also gave a rousing speech at the White House right after Joe Biden, talking about the strong relations between the two countries. ""Today India and the US are walking shoulder-to-shoulder from the depths of the ocean to heights of the sky, from ancient culture to artificial intelligence,"" PM Modi said.

""This grand welcome ceremony at the White House today is an honour and pride for the 1.4 billion people of India. It is also an honour for more than 4 million people of Indian origin in the US,"" the prime minister further added.

Later, PM Modi held one-on-one talks with Biden in the Oval Office of the White House before holding delegation-level talks. Both leaders discussed a wide range of issues of mutual and global interests, aimed at further boosting the Indo-US strategic relations in areas like defence, space, clean energy and critical technologies.

Another major highlight of the meeting was PM Modi presenting a unique gift to US First Lady Jill Biden – a rare green diamond made inside a lab, with a splendid cut and clarity.

Noting that Modi and Biden are meeting on all the three days of the Indian leader's stay in Washington, official sources said the prime minister's maiden state visit to the US is likely to deepen the two countries' like never before. This was the second interaction between the two leaders within 24 hours.

The discussions he had with PM Modi were focussed around making significant investments in India. He also spoke about some future plans and initiatives focussing on sustainable energy solutions like solar and wind. Tesla CEO also spoke about his plans to bring Starlink Internet to India.

Elon was also asked about his plans to visit India, and he mentioned that PM Modi did invite him to visit the country soon. Musk said that he might visit India next year and that he is really looking forward to this visit."
215,https://www.cfr.org/blog/what-did-prime-minister-modis-state-visit-achieve,What Did Prime Minister Modi’s State Visit Achieve?,,"Last week Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi completed a four-day state visit to the United States. Modi was not only feted with a welcome ceremony and state dinner, but was also invited to address Congress for the second time during his prime ministership. These high-profile events were intended to reflect the two countries’ shared commitment to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and signify that the United States sees India as a critical partner. Judging by the attention paid to Modi’s arrival and the deals announced, both countries came away with winning outcomes, singly and jointly.

For India, the honors bestowed on Modi—a man who just a few years ago was denied entry to the United States for his role in the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat—showed to the world that far from being a pariah, he is now the powerful and accepted leader of a valued partner country. The United States also offered concrete wins. The Biden administration promised to help India increase production of electric vehicles and meet its goal of installing 500 gigawatts of wind, solar, and other renewable energy this decade. U.S. memory chip firm Micron Technology will invest up to $825 million in a new chip assembly and test plant in Gujarat, which will be its first factory in India. On immigration, which has been a thorny issue, the United States agreed to allow a small number of Indians on H-1B visas to renew them in the United States without traveling abroad.

The United States too made symbolic and material gains. In terms of symbolic wins, the United States was able to showcase its close partnership with India—a country that also shares its deep anxiety about the specter of a rising China—and highlight the exchange of effusive warm statements between President Biden and Prime Minister Modi a mere two days after the former labelled President of China Xi Jinping a “dictator.” There were also material wins. Indian solar panel maker Vikram Solar Limited will invest up to $1.5 billion in the U.S. solar energy supply chain. India has also agreed to join the U.S.-led Artemis Accords on space exploration and will work with NASA on a joint mission to the International Space Station in 2024. In a huge political win for the Biden administration, India will remove retaliatory tariffs imposed on U.S. products such as chickpeas and apples without the expectation that the United States will remove its own tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that had initially led to these retaliatory tariffs.

Perhaps most importantly, both countries scored wins in their defense and strategic partnership. U.S. company General Electric has signed a memorandum of understanding with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to produce fighter jet engines for the Indian Air Force. While the deal is subject to congressional approval, this is a huge step both for India, which can domestically manufacture fighter jets but not the engines to power them, and for the United States, which is very choosy about the sharing of military technology. Moreover, India’s defense ministry has approved the purchase of armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones (a type of Predator drone) made by General Atomics, which will enhance the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities of India’s armed forces across domains. Currently, only some U.S. allies own Predator drones. The two countries also established a Joint Indo-U.S. Quantum Coordination Mechanism to facilitate joint research between public and private sectors and launched the INDUS-X partnership to expand their strategic technology and defense industrial cooperation. India also agreed to join the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), a U.S.-led partnership with twelve other countries plus the European Union, to create critical energy minerals supply chains.

Finally, and significantly, Prime Minister Modi was also persuaded to take two questions in a joint press conference with President Biden. Although the two leaders sidestepped public critique and offered awkward answers to a U.S. reporter’s question about democracy and human rights (the less-loaded second question from an Indian reporter was about climate change), the fact that Modi, who has not held a press conference in nearly a decade, agreed to respond to reporters at all was a further indication of how important the bilateral relationship has become for both nations."
216,https://www.news18.com/world/narendra-modi-us-visit-2023-today-live-updates-livenews-8157943.html,PM Modi US-Egypt Visit Highlights: PM Holds Meeting with Egyptian Counterpart Madbouly in Cairo,2023-06-24 23:56:50+05:30,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US was not about leveraging India to be a “counterweight” to China but to deepen ties, including defence cooperation, between the largest democracies of the world, a top White House official has said. Prime Minister Modi on Saturday left for Egypt after concluding his state visit during which he held wide-ranging talks with President Joe Biden and addressed the joint session of the US Congress.

He visited the US at the invitation of President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. This state visit wasn’t about China. Look, India has challenges with China as well, right on their doorstep, but also more broadly in the region. And, clearly, the challenges presented by the People’s Republic of China to both our nations were on the agenda yesterday, no question about that, said John Kirby, Coordinator for Strategic Communications at the National Security Council in the White House.

But this wasn’t about leveraging India to be some sort of counterweight. India is a sovereign independent state. They have their own foreign policy that they have to manage. And they live in a tough neighbourhood, he told reporters at a news conference here on Friday. Kirby said India is becoming an increasing exporter of security, which the US welcomes."
217,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/21/whats-behind-indian-prime-minister-narendra-modis-us-visit,What’s behind Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s US visit?,2023-06-21 00:00:00,"The US is seeking stronger ties with India, which it sees as a vital ally in efforts to contain China’s rise.

The administration of United States President Joe Biden is scheduled to host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an official visit later this week, as the two countries strengthen their ties amid shared antipathy towards China’s growing influence.

The White House will hold a state dinner in Modi’s honour on June 22, a sign of the burgeoning relationship between the two powers who have stepped up cooperation in areas such as trade and arms sales.

In a press release, the Biden administration said that a recent trip to New Delhi by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan “underscored the dynamism of the US-India partnership in advance of Prime Minister Modi’s historic official state visit next week to the United States”.

But human rights groups say the celebratory dinner is a de facto endorsement of India’s far-right turn under Modi’s leadership — and undermines the Biden administration’s stated goal of emphasising human rights and democracy in its foreign policy.

During Modi’s tenure, India’s Muslims and other minorities have experienced an uptick in violence and repression as the government leans into a form of Hindu nationalism known as Hindutva. Modi has also been criticised for seeking to consolidate power and crack down on dissent.

“A state dinner is a special occasion; it’s not something that just any foreign leader receives,” Edward Mitchell, the deputy executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told Al Jazeera over a phone call.

“How can the White House honour a leader who is an open anti-Muslim bigot, a right-wing ideologue who censors journalists and turns a blind eye to lynchings? You can work with India and Modi without taking this extra step to celebrate him.”





Confronting China

While advocacy groups have called for greater scrutiny of India’s human rights record, foreign policy experts say the Biden administration is primarily interested in the country as a potential counterweight to China, which the US sees as its most formidable global competitor.

Sarang Shidore, Director of Studies and Senior Research Fellow at the Quincy Institute, a US-based think tank, told Al Jazeera that he believes the US-India relationship will continue to grow as long as their shared concern over China remains in place.

“The United States does not conduct its foreign policy based on democracy and human rights. It conducts its foreign policy based on its interests, as all states do,” Shidore said.

China’s growing military power and assertive territorial claims have become a source of concern for nearby Asian countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Japan and India. The US has worked to fashion alliances with many of those countries in an attempt to contain China’s expanding influence.

“No question, there is increased Chinese nationalism,” said Shidore. “And China sees India as an increasing challenge due to its relationship with the US.”





Expanding ties

That was not always the case. During the Cold War, India’s relations with the US were often frosty. The country had cultivated close ties with the USSR and helped spearhead the Non-Aligned Movement, an organisation of countries that rejected pressures to join either pro-US or pro-Soviet blocs.

For its part, the US was a key ally of Pakistan. And by the early 1970s, the administration of US President Richard Nixon started to build a cooperative relationship with China, as an attempt, in part, to place pressure on the USSR.

But as the Cold War ended and China’s economic rise became a preoccupation of US foreign policy, India — with its size and economic heft — started to be seen as a key regional ally.

Despite its improved ties with the US, however, India has continued to resist what it sees as a false choice between the US and countries like President Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

But as Russia wages war in Ukraine and Washington seeks to isolate Moscow economically and diplomatically, that balancing act has become more difficult for India to maintain.

While India has increased its purchase of weapons from countries such as France and the US and recently agreed on a roadmap to increase cooperation with the US defence industry, it remains the world’s largest importer of Russian arms.

India has also joined China in buying up Russian oil at discounted prices, while the US and the European Union angle to limit Russia’s power in the global energy market.

But Shidore said that India’s status as a central player in Washington’s Asia strategy gives it significant leverage. Its ties to Russia are not likely to get in the way of its relationship with the US, he explained.

“India has played this quite well, playing Russia and the US off each other, and has benefitted in the process,” he said. “A country like India, which has such a strong convergence with the US on China, can create major spaces where it will differ very strongly from the US and can ride that out.”





Consolidating control

While US relations with allies such as Saudi Arabia and Israel have come under political scrutiny in recent years, Modi’s trip to the US has been welcomed with bipartisan support. An a joint letter inviting Modi to address Congress during his visit, members of the US House of Representatives and Senate have hailed the visit as a sign of the “enduring friendship” between the two countries.

“During your address, you will have the opportunity to share your vision for India’s future and speak to the global challenges our countries both face,” the letter reads.

However, Modi’s human rights record has not gone entirely unremarked. On Tuesday, a group of more than 70 lawmakers from the US House and Senate penned a letter to the Biden urging him to discuss concerns about religious freedom and journalistic expression in his talks with Modi.

The Muslim rights group CAIR, meanwhile, has issued a statement calling on the White House to drop its plans for a state dinner.

Modi’s high-profile reception in the US is a far cry from what he experienced before he was first elected prime minister in 2014. Prior to becoming India’s leader, Modi had been banned from entering the US due to allegations that he turned a blind eye to anti-Muslim violence in the western Indian state of Gujarat in 2002, when he was the province’s chief minister.

The deadly 2002 riots were the subject of a BBC documentary that Modi tried to ban in January, invoking his emergency powers as prime minister. The rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch screened the documentary in Washington on Tuesday.

Human rights groups say the move to ban the film was representative of a larger effort under Modi to stifle dissent and exercise control over independent institutions. They also accuse his government of pursuing an agenda influenced by far-right Hindu nationalism.

In an annual report on religious freedom in May, the US State Department expressed concern about the situation in India, noting that there were “open calls for genocide against Muslims”, lynchings and “attacks on places of worship”.

In May, for the fourth year in a row, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom called on the State Department to designate India as a “country of particular concern”.

In some states controlled by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), politicians who lean into violent anti-Muslim rhetoric face little reprimand. Some Hindu nationalist paramilitaries have also waged a campaign against interfaith marriages, which they portray as an effort to dilute the Hindu population and win converts to Islam through “love jihad”.

Shidore, however, said that Modi’s human rights record has been quickly “papered over” and is unlikely to prevent cooperation with the US, so long as China remains a serious global competitor.

“The United States”, he said, “has set human rights issues aside in order to strengthen ties”."

PM Modi has visited the US six times since 2014, meeting three presidents: Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, but this will be his first State visit. The state visit is considered an honour which is reserved for America’s closest allies and friends.

On June 23, Modi will address an invitation-only gathering of diaspora leaders from across the country at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington DC. Modi’s event with the Indian diaspora will focus on their role in ‘India’s growth story’.

PM Modi’s address to Indian diaspora in the US: Top 5 points

219,https://time.com/6288278/modi-state-visit-biden-india-key-issues/,What to Expect from Narendra Modi's Official U.S. Visit,2023-06-20 02:12:43+00:00,"On Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden will meet India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on an official state visit in Washington D.C, which includes a South Lawn welcome, a state dinner, and an address to a joint session of Congress—an honor rarely granted to a visiting foreign leader. Modi will become just the third world leader, after France’s Emmanuel Macron and South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol, to receive this kind of diplomatic reception from President Biden.

While Modi has visited the U.S. many times—most recently for a three-day visit in September 2021, where he held a bilateral meeting with Biden—this will be the first time the Prime Minister’s trip will be categorized as the highest ranked visit according to diplomatic protocol. (The last state visit to the U.S. by an Indian leader was by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in November 2009.)

As India takes center stage as the world’s most populous country, one of the fastest growing economies, and a powerhouse for tech and innovation, the Biden Administration hopes it can court the country as a crucial ally to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

“The visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space,” the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.

Below, what to know about the upcoming visit.

What are the top priorities for Modi’s state visit?

The state visit will include conversations aimed at further cementing an already-growing defense and manufacturing relationship between the U.S. and India. More recently, Washington and New Delhi have been engaged in discussions about jointly producing jet engines, long-range artillery, and military vehicles. In May, India joined Biden’s 14-member Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which primarily aims to reduce China’s economic dominance through manufacturing, but without drawing up a formal trade agreement. Now, American company General Electric is hoping to co-produce military jets in the country, while the U.S. has increased investment in a semiconductor and chip manufacturing ecosystem set in India as a way to decrease dependence on Chinese manufacturing.

“The United States has really oriented a lot of its domestic and foreign policy around this question of, ‘how do we counter the Chinese challenge?’” says Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at Carnegie. “So if you think about semiconductors and chip manufacturing, India is a big player right now.”

In the weeks leading up to Modi’s visit, both the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have also made trips to New Delhi in an attempt to cut through the red tape to secure deals.

This week, Reuters reported that India was inching closer to buying more than two dozen U.S.-made armed drones worth $2 to $3 billion to help enhance border surveillance and improve counterterrorism intelligence operations. The development comes after Sullivan, along with India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, unveiled an ambitious roadmap for Indo-U.S. collaboration in specific high-technology areas, including semiconductors, next-generation telecommunication, artificial intelligence and defense.

For India, striking deals with the U.S. will in turn strengthen the country’s hard power capabilities and make it a hotbed for innovation. “They are hoping to get more U.S. dollars, more U.S. companies, and more U.S. entrepreneurs to make India a central part of their growth and expansion plans,” says Vaishnav.

Why do the U.S. and India want to counter China?

Experts say both countries see their strategic interests converge in countering China’s threat as it becomes more expansionist and ambitious on the global stage. For the U.S., China has increasingly become its biggest competitor in the spheres of influence, while India has been embroiled in territorial disputes in the Himalayas ever since it fought a brief war with China in 1962.

In 2020, tensions between India and China flared when Beijing became more assertive over land claims along the shared Himalayan border and an altercation between Indian and Chinese military forces in the northern Indian region of Ladakh reportedly left 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead. China’s close ties to Pakistan has also resulted in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as part of the Belt and Road Initiative and controversially passes through a section of Kashmir controlled by Islamabad, adding to India’s concerns.

By helping India build up its economic and defense capabilities, Washington hopes to coordinate with New Delhi to tackle global challenges as part of its long-term interests, says Vaishnav. “Washington is really looking to create a framework of deterrence to essentially deter Chinese expansionism, and they view India as a linchpin in this strategy,” he says.

How has the relationship between India and the U.S. changed?

Relations between India and the U.S. have changed in notable ways over the years. After independence from British rule in 1947, India was more closely aligned with Russia during the Cold War era due to U.S. distrust and estrangement over India’s nuclear program, while the U.S. had a stronger partnership with India’s rival, Pakistan.

The two countries remained “estranged democracies,” according to the former U.S. Ambassador, Dennis Kux, until the early 1990s. However, since the early 2000s, U.S. administrations from Bill Clinton to Donald Trump have worked to build a strong relationship with India, recognizing its potential to be a strategic partner in ensuring the security of the Indo-Pacific region.

In 2005, India and the U.S. signed a major nuclear deal under which India was recognized de facto as a nuclear weapons power. More recently, India’s participation in the Quad, a security alliance between the U.S. and its allies, Australia, Japan and India, has led to the country becoming a critical element of American defense strategy.

Last year, the two countries conducted joint military exercises not far from the disputed Indo-China border, and in May, joined Biden’s 14-member Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which officials and business executives hope will reduce American reliance on Chinese manufacturing for mutual benefit, including increased iPhone shipments from Indian-based factories.

At a joint news conference after his summit talks with Biden, Modi also stoutly defended his government's record on democracy and human rights, asserting democracy is ""in our spirit...and flows in our veins"" and that there was no discrimination against minorities.

The two leaders lauded the growing relations between India and the US with the President saying it was among the ""most consequential"" in the world that is stronger, closer and more dynamic at any time in history.

Modi, who arrived at the White House on his maiden pomp-filled state visit amid rapturous cheers of 'Modi, Modi' from the crowd gathered on the South Lawn, on his part asserted that for the partnership between the two countries, ""even the sky is not the limit"".

As the US administration rolled out the red carpet to Modi with the camaraderie between the President and the Prime Minister on full display, Biden described the ties between the two countries as ""one of the most defining"" relationships in the 21st century.

""The challenges and opportunities facing the world in this century require that India and the United States work and lead together and we are. Two great nations, two great friends, two great powers that can define the course of the 21st century,"" he said at the ceremonial welcome.

Several thousand Indian-Americans, who have converged in the American capital from far and near, attended the welcome ceremony.

Modi, who is on his sixth visit to the US as prime minister, was welcomed at the South Lawn with a 21-gun salute and playing of the national anthems of India and the US.

At the news conference, Modi asserted that the basic foundation stone of his regime has been “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas” which means together for everyone’s growth, with everyone’s trust.

He said there is no question of discrimination in India on the grounds of caste or religion because his government follows the Constitution, which is formed on the basic values of democracy.

He was responding to a question by a western journalist on reports about human rights and freedom of press in India.

""I am surprised that you are saying that 'people say'. It's not that people say, India is a democracy and as President Biden said India and US, democracy is in the DNA of both. Democracy is our spirit. It's in our veins. We live democracy and our ancestors penned it in words in the form of the Constitution."" With India and the US set to elevate their strategic partnership, GE Aerospace announced it has inked a pact with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to jointly produce fighter jet engines for Indian Air Force’s Light Combat Aircraft (LCA)-Mk-II Tejas.

""We have transitioned today to a relationship involving the transfer of technology, co-development and co-production. The decision taken by General Electric to manufacture engines in India through the transfer of technology is a landmark agreement,"" Modi said. The pact envisages manufacture of F414 engines in India and it will enable greater transfer of US jet engine technology than ever before.

In another big ticket announcement, computer storage chip maker Micron said it will set up its semiconductor assembly and test plant in Gujarat entailing a total investment of USD 2.75 billion (around Rs 22,540 crore).

Modi also said India and the US are collaborating to send an Indian astronaut to the International Space Station in 2024.

“We have decided to join the Artemis Accords. We have taken a giant leap in our space cooperation."" Biden and Modi also welcomed India’s plans to procure General Atomics MQ-9B HALE UAVs. The drones would further bolster India's national security and surveillance capabilities not only in the Indian Ocean but also along the frontier with China.

The MQ-9Bs, which will be assembled in India, will enhance the ISR capabilities of India’s armed forces across domains.

As part of this plan, General Atomics will also establish a Comprehensive Global MRO facility in India to support of India’s long-term goals to boost indigenous defense capabilities.

Biden said India and the US were collaborating in nearly every human endeavour in delivering progress across the board.

He said the two countries are doubling down on their cooperation to secure their semiconductor supply chains, advancing Open RAN telecommunications networks and growing the major defense partnership with more joint exercises, more cooperation between defense industries, and more consultation and coordination across all domains.

“Our economic relationship is booming. Trade between our countries has almost doubled over the past decade to more than $191 billion, supporting tens of thousands of good jobs in both India and the United States. Add to that 1 million American jobs across 44 states will be supported by the purchase of more than 200 American made Boeing aircraft that Air India announced earlier this year."" In response to a question on climate change to the two leaders by PTI correspondent Kumar Rakesh, Biden said climate change is an existential threat to humanity.

Modi said India is the only G20 country that has fulfilled all the promises it made in Paris on climate change, asserting it will not only fulfil its responsibilities but will also help others including the US in this critical area.

Modi said India and the US are walking shoulder-to-shoulder in the fight against terrorism and radicalism, and added that during his talks with Biden, the two sides have agreed that concerted action is necessary to end cross-border terrorism.

""For the partnership between India and the US, even the sky is not the limit. The most important pillar of our relations is our people-to-people ties. More than 40 lakh people of Indian origin are contributing to the development of America."" ""We have also decided that like trusted partners the US and India will prepare a reliable, secure, resilient global supply chain and value chain, amid global uncertainties."" As part of efforts to boost people-to-people relationships, the Biden administration has decided to open two new consulates in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad while India will establish a mission in Seattle.

The prime minister said India is ready to contribute in any way it can to restore peace in Ukraine, reiterating that New Delhi favours the resolution of the dispute through dialogue and diplomacy.

After the ceremonial welcome and ahead of the delegation-level parleys, Modi held one-on-one talks with Biden at the Oval Office to discuss a wide range of issues of mutual and global interests, aimed at further boosting the Indo-US strategic relations in areas like defence, space, clean energy and critical technologies.

In his initial remarks, Modi told Biden that the President's commitment to the ties between the two countries has prompted India to take ""bold and audacious"" measures.

Modi said the Constitution of both countries begins with the ""three words--We the People--as President Biden just mentioned"".

Thanking Biden, his wife Jill Biden and the US administration for a warm and grand welcome, Modi said this is the first time the gates of the White House have been opened for Indian-Americans in such large numbers.

""This grand welcome ceremony at the White House today is an honour and pride for the 1.4 billion people of India. It is also an honour for more than 4 million people of Indian origin in the US."" He said about three decades ago, he had come to America as a common man and at that time,he had seen the White House from the outside.

But times, titles and political agendas change.

President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden welcomed Modi, the prime minister of India, to the White House on Thursday for a state visit filled with the kind of pomp and pageantry afforded only to the nation’s closest friends.

Standing next to Modi on the White House South Lawn, Biden said he has long believed that the relationship between the United States and India will be “one of the defining relationships of the 21st century.”

Modi was denied a visa to enter the U.S. in 2005, when he was the chief minister of the Indian state of Gujarat, over accusations that he had failed to stop deadly riots against minority Muslims. But now that he’s the leader of the world’s largest democracy, the Biden administration has been embracing him more closely as it seeks to counter China’s global influence.

Given Modi’s history with the U.S., there were bound to be some unusual, and even awkward, moments during his state visit:

Pomp and pageantry:Here's why Democrats and Republicans welcome a visit from right-wing Indian PM Narendra Modi

Red carpets and yellow yoga mats

Not many state visits start with yoga.

But Modi not only walked the red carpet, he stretched out on a yellow yoga mat.

Modi, a yoga enthusiast, and roughly 1,000 other practitioners of the Hindu spiritual and aesthetic discipline demonstrated their technique on Wednesday, Day One of Modi’s four-day visit to the United States.

The 72-year-old grey-bearded prime minister took his place on a mat on the grassy North Lawn area outside the United Nations headquarters in New York. For the next half hour, he practiced breathing exercises, meditation, backbends and other poses.

""Namaste,"" he told the crowd before the exercises began.

The event was held in recognition of the International Day of Yoga, which Modi persuaded the U.N. to observe annually not long after he became India’s leader in 2014. This year’s event set a Guinness World Record for most nationalities – 135 – at a yoga session.

Modi’s message to his fellow yoga enthusiasts: ""Let's use the power of yoga, not only to be healthy, happy, but to be kind to ourselves and each other.”

Yoga diplomacy:Ahead of U.S. state visit, India's leader takes to his mat at the U.N.

The first lady and Modi take a field trip

The first couple of times the Bidens hosted a foreign dignitary for a state visit, Jill Biden arranged an outing with the leader’s spouse.

She took Brigitte Macron, wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, to the interactive Plant Word museum just a few blocks from the White House. Kim Keon Hee, wife of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, got a private tour of the National Gallery of Art.

But Modi’s spouse didn’t accompany him on the trip to Washington. What’s more, Joe Biden wasn’t in town for Modi’s arrival on Wednesday. He was traveling back to Washington from California, where he had been raising money for his reelection campaign.

So the first lady and the prime minister took a quick field trip to National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside Washington, to highlight workforce training programs.

Modi, who arrived late, missed a demonstration of a robot creating abstract art on paper and another showing how an underwater robot can be used to aid fishing. But in brief remarks, he said his government has established labs in schools to encourage young entrepreneurs.

His goal, he said, is to make this decade a “tech decade.”

A plant-based feast

The night before the official state dinner, the Bidens hosted Modi for a private dinner at the White House, where they dined on a few of the president’s favorite foods, including pasta and ice cream.

The menu for the official state dinner on Thursday catered to Modi’s palate.

Modi is a vegetarian, so the 400 invited guests were served an entirely plant-based meal: A salad of marinated millet. Corn and compressed watermelon. Stuffed portobello mushrooms and saffron risotto. Strawberry shortcake infused with rose and cardamom.

The first lady enlisted the help of chef Nina Curtis, who specializes in plant-based cooking, to work with White House chefs to come up with the menu.

Guests were given the option of adding fish to the main course.

Modi (finally) meets the press

It’s not unusual for Biden to hold a joint news conference with foreign leaders when they visit the White House.

But when Modi took the dais in the White House East Room on Thursday for a Q&A with Biden, it was a remarkable turn of events.

Modi, who tries to avoid unscripted moments and has presided over a steady decline in press freedom in his country, has never held a solo news conference and often avoids questions by deferring to others on stage with him.

Biden and Modi each answered two questions – one from an Indian journalist who asked Modi about climate change, the other from a Wall Street Journal reporter who pressed him on human rights concerns. It was the first time Modi had fielded a question at a news conference since he came to power in 2014.

The news conference was a scaled-down affair compared with those usually held as part of a state visit. Even so, Modi’s advisers were far from thrilled with the idea. Administration officials advised his team that taking questions from the media was standard protocol for White House state visits.

Modi’s people finally relented and agreed to the news conference – but not until the day it was to be held.

'No space for discrimination':India's leader claims government doesn't have a human rights problem

'No space for discrimination' in India

Modi’s state visit infuriated human rights advocates who blame him for widespread attacks against India’s Muslims and other minorities.

Biden’s administration has accused India’s government of participating in unlawful and arbitrary killings, restricting freedom of speech and allowing violence against religious, racial and ethnic minorities. A group of more than 70 lawmakers asked Biden in a letter Tuesday to raise the human rights concerns during Modi’s visit.

But during his joint news conference with Biden, Modi insisted there was no discrimination in India and argued that democracy is in India’s DNA.

“Democracy is our spirit, democracy runs in our veins – we live democracy,” he said, speaking through an interpreter.

“There's absolutely no space for discrimination,"" he insisted, which must have been news to his detractors.

Investments and Plans Promised for India after PM Modi Visit

A number of companies have declared their intent to strengthen technology ties with India with various new investments and initiatives. Sundar Pichai, CEO, Alphabet and Google, discussed exploring further avenues of collaboration in the domains of artificial intelligence, fintech, cybersecurity products and services as well as mobile device manufacturing in India with PM Modi. Pichai announced a new fintech operation centre in GIFT city Gujarat.

“We are excited today that we are announcing the opening up of our global fintech operation centre in GIFT city Gujarat. We shared with the Prime Minister that Google is investing $10 billion in India digitisation fund. We are bringing Bard to more Indian languages very soon. Prime Minister’s vision for Digital India was way ahead of his time I now see as a blueprint other countries are looking to do,” said Pichai.

Andrew Jassy, CEO, Amazon, stated that the company was interested in creating jobs in India. “Very interested in helping create more jobs, helping digitise more small and medium size businesses and helping more Indian companies and products be exported all around the world. We have already invested 11 billion dollars, with an intention to invest another 15 billion dollars bringing total to 26 billion dollars,” he said.

Other Investments Announced

But, this visit assumes a lot of signifance because none of his visits earlier to the US were classified as a ‘state visit’.

For a state visit is considered as the highest ranked visit by a head of the government of a state.

Modi’s earlier visits fell under the category of a working visit (2014), working lunch (2016) and official working visit (2017). While, his 2019 visit has been described by the US officially, as one in which Modi “Participated in a rally in Houston, Texas”.

On June 21, Modi will travel to the US on his first state visit at the invitation of President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. All eyes are on Modi’s high-profile visit to the US predicted by political analysts to be a “significant milestone” in the India US bilateral relationship.

Here’s why all eyes are on Modi’s state visit to the US on June 21 to June 24:

Why is this visit different?

This is said to be Modi’s first state visit to the US during his nine-year long reign as PM. This means that US President Joe Biden will host Modi during his visit and he will be offered a room for four days and three nights at Blair House, the President’s official guest house, located within walking distance of the White House.

What are state visits?

It is the highest ranked visit and are accorded to America’s closest allies and friends. It is to be differentiated from other kinds of visits accorded to a ranking member of a foreign government like an “official visit,” an “official working visit,” a “working visit,” and a “private visit.” The “state visit” , the highest ranking visit can only be offered to a chief of state – such as the President of a country or a reigning monarch – and must be at the invitation of the US President.

It is the highest expression of friendly bilateral relations and is full of official public ceremonies. It is a visit of a state rather than visit of a leader.

What will the state visit involve?

In short, a state visit ensures a meeting with the US President, a state dinner at the White House, a full honors arrival and departure ceremony on the south grounds of the White House, and a 21 gun salute. Gifts may be exchanged and spouses can attend the ceremonies and dinners.

On June 22, the US President and his wife will host a state dinner. Earlier, on the south lawns of the White House, President Biden and the First Lady will welcome the Indian Prime Minister amid a 21-gun salute. The White House has sent out invitations for the welcome ceremony, which many Indian Americans were clambering to be invited to.

This invitation reportedly marks the first time a country-specific diaspora has been invited to the White House in such large numbers, said news reports.

Why is this visit important?

According to political analysts, Modi has been invited for several bilateral and multilateral meetings with American Presidents in the past, but this official ‘state visit’ accompanied with a state dinner before the G20 Summit in September, is a signal that the US considers India to be an equal partner. The first Indian Prime Minister to receive a state dinner at the White House was Jawaharlal Nehru in October 1949, after which many Indian PMs have been invited to enjoy a sumptuous meal at the White House.

The visit is also meant to strengthen the two countries’ “shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific” and their shared resolve to elevate their strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space, said official releases by the two countries.

Why is US wooing India?

At another level, the visit is important for the US as it tries to counter China’s growing clout and wants to possibly shift its investments to India, said experts. According to political scientists, the Biden administration is “desperately courting India” because they need a potential counter to China, for the purpose of establishing a “global supply chain and for investment reasons.”

This visit can also provide an opening for the US to urge India to openly condemn Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“We look forward to hosting Indian Prime Minister @NarendraModi in June, whose visit will celebrate the deep partnership between the United States and India,” US Secretary of Stae, Anthony Blinken tweeted recently, weeks before Modi’s visit.

While John Kirby, White House National Security Council spokesperson told reporters recently on June 6, two weeks before Modi’s visit, “India is a strong partner of US at very many levels.” He cited additional defence cooperation deals, “lot of economic trade”, and for India being a member of the Quad and a key partner and friend of Indo-Pacific security.

“There’s innumberable reasons why India certainly matters not just bilaterally between the two of our nations, but multi-laterally on many multiple levels,” he stressed.

Analysts believe that the US is looking for a location for its manufacturing. The classic case often given is of Apple, which has launched manufacturing in India and is expected to export 20 million iPhone 14s. There are a lot of other companies also looking from that perspective, said experts. There’s also a key General Electric deal in the offing, which involves building GE engines that will power HAL’s Tejas-Mk II Light Combat Aircraft.

The signing of the MoU with General Electric will be one of the biggest deliverable of Prime Minister Modi’s State visit to the US, said news reports. With bilateral trade reaching a record-breaking $191 billion last year, the US-India Business Council (USIBC) will host the INDUS-X conference scheduled to be held over two days in Washington to coincide with Modi’s visit. INDUS-X is a platform for start-ups and enterprises from both countries to identify collaborations for high-tech innovations within the ambit of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET).

Why is this visit important for Modi?

‘Diaspora diplomacy’ has been one of Modi’s key political strategies since he was the Gujarat Chief Minister. This US visit is crucial for Modi’s global image, to show off India’s global grandstanding and to send the message back home that Modi as the leader has accomplished this. This is important for Modi before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

One of the highlights of Modi’s visit to the US?

Modi will address a joint session of the US Congress during his state visit to Washington DC on June 22, becoming the only Indian PM to address the joint sitting of the US Congress twice.

The Congressional leaders invited Modi “on behalf of the bipartisan leadership of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate”, to address a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday, June 22. It will be the second time that Modi will address a joint meeting of the US Congress, the first being in 2016. At that time, he was the fifth Indian PM to address the joint session of US Congress, the others being Manmohan Singh (2005), Atal Bihari Vajpayee (2000), PV Narasimha Rao (1994) and Rajiv Gandhi (1985).

Other key activities on Modi’s US visit agenda?

On the agenda are agreements on trade, defence and critical minerals and significant progression of the Indo-US defence partnership, with the signing of a joint production agreement.

Ahead of Modi’s state visit, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in India on a two-day visit to explore ways to lay the groundwork for highly anticipated agreements on bilateral defence cooperation, especially in areas of transfer of critical technologies for co-development of military hardware.

What are the events organised by the Indian diaspora?

Multiple events have been planned to extend a grand welcome to Modi.

An ‘India Unity Day’ march is being planned from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC to welcome Modi, two days before Modi’s arrival in America.

Other such marches are being planned in 20 other places, including New York’s Times Square and San Francisco’s Golden Bridge. A group of Indian Americans will be at the Andrews Air Force Base to welcome Modi as he lands on June 21 afternoon in New York. While hundreds of the community members will gather at Lafayette Square Park in front of the White House.

The Indian diaspora has planned “a cultural event spanning Kashmir to Kanyakumari, and West to East in front of the White House”, to showcase the growth of India during Modi’s term in the past nine years.

News reports said that Modi may well lead the International Yoga Day celebrations on June 21 in New York.

Who’s organising these events?

The Overseas Friends of BJP (OFBJP) USA, along with other right-wing organisations such as the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh, which has approximately 205 local chapters, including in college campuses will organise these events.

This same groups had organised Modi’s meeting at New York’s Madison Square Garden in 2014 and the “Howdy Modi” jamboree in Texas featuring Modi and Donald Trump in 2019. Many people flocked to these events and chanted Modi’s name giving him a rockstar reception. It is said that crowd of over 50,000 people was present when Modi and Trump jointly addressed the ‘Howdy Modi!’ gathering in Houston, Texas."

This special invitation is a reflection of the vigour and vitality of the partnership between our democracies.

I will commence my visit in New York, where I will celebrate the International Day of Yoga on June 21 at the United Nations Headquarters with the UN leadership and members of the international community. I look forward to this special celebration at the very location that supported India’s proposal in December 2014 to recognize an International Day of Yoga.

I will thereafter travel to Washington D.C. President Biden and I have had the opportunity to meet several times since my last Official Visit to the USA in September 2021. This visit will be an opportunity to enrich the depth and diversity of our partnership.

India-US ties are multifaceted, with deepening engagements across sectors. USA is India’s largest trade partner in goods and services. We collaborate closely in science & technology, education, health, defence and security fields. The initiative on Critical & Emerging Technologies has added new dimensions and widened collaboration to defence industrial cooperation, space, telecom, quantum, Artificial Intelligence and biotech sectors. Our two countries are also collaborating to further our shared vision of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.

My discussions with President Biden and other senior US leaders will provide an opportunity to consolidate our bilateral cooperation as well as in plurilateral forums such as G20, Quad and IPEF.

I will also have the pleasure of joining President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden for the State Banquet along with a number of dignitaries.

The US Congress has always provided strong bi-partisan support to India-US ties. During my visit, I will address a Joint Session of the US Congress at the invitation of Congressional leadership.

Strong people-to-people linkages have been instrumental in developing the trust between our countries. I look forward to meeting the vibrant Indian-American community that represents the best of our societies. I will also meet some of the leading CEOs to discuss opportunities for elevating our trade and investment relationship and for building resilient global supply chains.

I am confident that my visit to the US will reinforce our ties based on shared values of democracy, diversity and freedom. Together we stand stronger in meeting the shared global challenges.

I will travel to Cairo from Washington D.C. at the invitation of President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. I am excited to pay a State Visit to a close and friendly country for the first time.

We had the pleasure of receiving President Sisi as the Chief Guest at our Republic Day celebrations this year. These two visits in the span of a few months is a reflection of our rapidly evolving partnership with Egypt, which was elevated to a ‘Strategic Partnership’ during President Sisi’s visit.

I look forward to my discussions with President Sisi and senior members of the Egyptian Government to impart further momentum to our civilizational and multi-faceted partnership. I will also have the opportunity to interact with the vibrant Indian diaspora in Egypt."

This visit highlights the close alliance between India and the US, with a particular focus on enhancing defense ties and promoting trade relations.

One of the anticipated outcomes of the visit is an unprecedented agreement on the transfer of jet engine technology. This deal is expected to facilitate the transfer of cutting-edge GE-F414 jet engine technology to India. There are hopes that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), in collaboration with General Electric, will manufacture the engine in India. The GE-F414 engine powers the F/A-18 Hornet, a key fighter aircraft used by the US Navy.

This transfer of technology would be a game-changer for the Indian aviation industry, as it would mark the first time the US has allowed such advanced technology to be shared with another country.

During his three-day visit, PM Modi has a busy schedule that includes several significant events. One highlight is his address to a joint session of the US Congress, which is an exceptional honor bestowed upon him for the second time.

#WATCH via ANI Multimedia | PM Modi embarks on his first State Visit to the United Stateshttps://t.co/Z2SySsotTq — ANI (@ANI) June 20, 2023

Only a select few individuals, such as Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela, have been given this opportunity in the past. The invitation to speak before Congress was extended by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, emphasizing the significance of this occasion.

Additionally, PM Modi is scheduled to meet with business leaders to discuss investment opportunities and further strengthen economic ties between India and the US.

The Indian diaspora will also have an opportunity to engage with the Prime Minister during his visit, with a gathering planned at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, D.C. Moreover, on World Yoga Day, PM Modi will lead a yoga event at the United Nations building, promoting the ancient Indian practice globally.

The visit has garnered immense support from Indian-Americans across the country, who are organizing gatherings at iconic locations such as Times Square in New York and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco to extend a warm welcome to PM Modi. Members of Congress, thought leaders, and people from various walks of life have expressed their enthusiasm for the visit, highlighting the depth of the India-US relationship.

It is worth noting that PM Modi is the third Indian leader to receive a state visit to the US, following the visits of former President Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan in 1963 and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2009. However, being invited by President Biden for a state visit and dinner sets PM Modi apart, emphasising the strong rapport and strategic partnership between India and the US.

Overall, PM Modi's state visit to the United States holds great significance in bolstering India-US defense ties, exploring avenues for trade and investment, and deepening the already strong bond between the two nations. The transfer of jet engine technology and the various engagements planned during the visit will contribute to further strengthening the relationship and fostering collaboration in diverse fields for the mutual benefit of both countries.

229,https://theprint.in/diplomacy/modi-highlights-unprecedented-trust-between-india-us-ahead-of-three-day-visit/1634256/,Modi highlights ‘unprecedented trust’ between India & US ahead of three-day visit,2023-06-20 12:47:50+00:00,"New Delhi: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi departs Tuesday for his first official state visit to the United States, he emphasised on the “unprecedented trust” between the leaders of the two countries in an interview with the American business daily The Wall Street Journal.

During his three-day visit from 21-23 June, the Prime Minister is expected to focus on deepening India-US ties in sectors such as defence cooperation, trade and technology, among others.

PM Modi, who in the interview called defence cooperation between the two countries “an important pillar of partnership”, is expected to sign multiple weapons manufacturing deals including a deal for production of engines for advanced light combat aircraft.

He is also expected to sign a multi-billion dollar agreement to enhance surveillance over India’s contested borders with China and across the Indian Ocean. A deal for the purchase of high-altitude armed Predator drones from the US is also expected to materialise.

These deals are, according to The Wall Street Journal, part of Washington’s efforts to reduce India’s dependence on Russia for military supplies such as arms, ammunition, tanks, fighter jets and S-400 air defence systems. The Indian government has abstained from voting on resolutions condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the UN Security Council — over which American lawmakers have expressed their ‘disappointment’.

Commenting on India’s stance in the war, PM Modi told The Wall Street Journal, “I think India’s position is well known and well understood in the entire world. The world has full confidence that India’s topmost priority is peace.”

He also noted that he has had several conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy during which he highlighted the need to resolve disputes between the two countries through “diplomacy and dialogue”, rather than war.

India’s growing role in world order

Apart from focusing on the significance of his upcoming trip to Washington, PM Modi also emphasised the growing role of India in the dynamic global order.

“India deserves a much higher, deeper and wider profile and a role”, the Prime Minister opined, while calling for the restructuring of international organisations such as the United Nations to better represent an increasingly multipolar world order. He also nodded towards India’s goal to become a member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).

PM Modi observed, “Look at the membership of key institutions — does it truly represent the voice of democratic values? A place like Africa — does it have a voice? India has such a huge population and is a bright spot in the global economy, but is it present?”

He further added, “There has to be an evaluation of the current membership and the world should be asked if it wants India to be there.”

PM Modi’s statements are in line with the Biden administration’s goal to revamp UNSC membership to address concerns over the council’s inability to restrain global conflicts like the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

According to The Washington Post, the US envoy to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has been in talks with diplomats from the 193 UN member states about a possible expansion of the UNSC’s permanent membership to include approximately 12 more nations without granting them veto power. Previously, the US has also pushed for Germany, Japan and India to become permanent members of the UN Security Council.

Supply chains, China & celebrating diversity

Shifting the focus to economic ties between India and the US, PM Modi in the interview stressed the increasingly strong trade ties between the two countries in recent years, with the US becoming India’s largest trading partner last year with trade reaching a record $191 billion. Furthermore, the US is also the second largest source for foreign direct investment (FDI) into India amounting to $10.5 billion by 2022.

He also promoted India’s growing role as a manufacturing hub, with American companies like Apple making investments in Karnataka and Telangana to expand iPhone production in the country. “The world today is more interconnected and interdependent than ever before. To create resilience, there should be more diversification in supply chains,” PM Modi said.

Growing tensions with China have been a common concern for both India and the US, with New Delhi and Beijing working together on proposals for disengagement in friction areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh following clashes in 2020.

The Prime Minister stated, “For normal bilateral ties with China, peace and tranquility in the border areas is essential. We have a core belief in respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, observing the rule of law and peaceful resolution of differences and disputes. At the same time, India is fully prepared and committed to protect its sovereignty and dignity.”

Looking inward, on accusations by human rights advocates against the Modi government of restricting religious freedom in the country, the Prime Minister opined that “people of every faith in the world are living in harmony in India”. He added that India celebrates its diversity.

Last month, the US State Department’s annual report on “international religious freedom” expressed concerns regarding India over “violence by law enforcement authorities against members of religious minorities”.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India will receive a lavish welcome on Thursday in Washington, where he will address a joint session of Congress and be feted by President Biden and the first lady in a state dinner at the White House — only the third state leader to be hosted by the current administration.

Swirling around the pageantry of a momentous visit for U.S.-India relations, seen as an affirmation of India’s rise as an economic and diplomatic power, will be weighty questions of geopolitical alignments with regard to China’s economic influence and Russia’s military aggression, as well as the erosion of India’s secular democracy under Mr. Modi. How much if any of that will be publicly addressed by the two leaders is unclear.

The visit is a significant diplomatic prize for Mr. Modi, who was once denied a visa to the United States for his role in religious riots in his home state, and as prime minister has increasingly consolidated power and edged his country closer to one-party rule."

PM Modi highlighted the commitment to deepen the friendship between India and the United States, emphasising that a lot has changed since his previous visit but the dedication has remained the same.

The PM referred to the trusted partnership between India and the US as a guiding light in this new dawn that focused on the importance of demonstrating that democracies matter and deliver.

“There have been many advances in AI - Artificial Intelligence. At the same time, there have been even more momentous developments in another AI - America, and India,” he said.

PM Modi received 15 standing ovations and 79 applauses on his address and here are the highlights of his speech.

On democracy and shared values

PM Modi spoke about the two democracies and playfully mentioned the “samosa caucus,” referring to Vice-President Kamala Harris and other senators of Indian origin in the US senate. He stated, “The foundation of America was inspired by the vision of a nation of equal people... There are millions here who have roots in India, some of them sit proudly in this chamber and there is one behind me”

He paid tribute to both Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr, stating, “We remember many others who worked for liberty, equality, and justice.”

“Democracy is one of our sacred and shared values. Democracy is a spirit that supports equality and dignity. Democracy is an idea that welcomes debate and discourse. Democracy is culture that gives wings to thought and expression,” he said.

The Prime Minister spoke about India's rich diversity being acknowledged as a natural way of life that the world is increasingly interested in exploring. Adding that despite diverse languages, parties, and dialects, India speaks in one voice when it comes to its nation.

He also highlighted India's economic growth, from being the 10th largest economy to now the fifth largest, with expectations of becoming the third-largest soon.

Moreover, India's vision extends beyond development that benefits women to women-led development, where women lead the journey of progress.

Climate change, development, and India’s vision

On climate change, PM Modi emphasised India’s commitment to democracy, inclusion, and sustainability, with responsible growth respecting the environment.

India became the only G20 country to meet its Paris commitment and the nation’s renewables account for over 40 per cent of our energy sources, which is nine years ahead of the target of 2030.

“Our mission is pro-planet progress, pro-planet prosperity, pro-planet people. We live by the motto of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'-the world is one family. Our engagement with the world is for everyone's benefit. The same spirit is also seen in the theme when we chair the G20 Summit, One Earth, One Family, One Future. Last week, all nations joined our proposal at the UN, to build a memorial wall to honour the peacekeepers. This year the whole world is celebrating the International Year of Millets, to promote sustainable agriculture” he said.

US and India synchronicity

The Prime Minister in his address, stressed on the partnerships and synchronicity of the economies of India and the US.

“When an American phone maker invests in India, it creates an entire ecosystem of jobs and opportunities, in both countries. When India and the US work together on semiconductors and critical minerals, it helps the world in making supply chains more diverse, resilient and reliable,” he stated.

He added that he agreed with President Biden that this was a defining partnership of this century as it “served a larger purpose.” The countries are now defense partners which adds to the “limitless” opportunities for synergies between the two nations.

Call for diplomacy and dialogue on Ukraine conflict

PM Modi expressed his concern over the Ukraine conflict and its severe consequences, considering it a return of war to Europe. He added that global order was based on respecting the United Nations charter through the peaceful resolution of disputes and maintaining sovereignty and territorial integrity.

“As I have said before and directly, this is not an era of war. This is an era of dialogue and diplomacy,” he said.

Global challenges of terrorism, Indo-pacific security, and the United Nations

The Prime Minister brought attention to the 9/11 attacks in the US and 26/11 in Mumbai, stating that even after two decades, radical terrorism was still a danger worldwide.

He stated, “We must revive multilateralism and reform multilateral institutions with better resources and representation that applies to all our global institutions of governance, especially the UN. When the world has changed, our institutions too must change or risk getting replaced by a world of rivalries without rules. In working for a new world order based on international law, our two countries will be at the forefront as partners.”

Adding that such threats underscored the shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, with stability being a central concern.

PM Modi concluded his address by reiterating that the “trusted partnership” between India and the US was “a guiding light in this new era.”"

Welcoming Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House this week for a state visit – the most elevated form of American diplomacy – required President Joe Biden to make certain trade-offs and Modi to step out of his comfort zone, for at least a few minutes.

Modi, massively popular in India, has demonstrated a drift toward authoritarianism that has worried the West. He’s cracked down on dissent, targeted journalists and introduced policies that human rights groups say discriminate against Muslims.

Yet Modi and India, the world’s largest democracy, also represent a lynchpin in Biden’s strategy in Asia. The country recently surpassed China to become the most populous country on Earth. No major global challenge, from climate change to advances in technology, can be addressed without India’s buy-in, in Biden’s view. And in an era of growing tensions between the US and China, there are few partners that Biden is more eager to cultivate.

That, according to officials, was the rationale behind inviting Modi for a state visit, only the third of Biden’s presidency so far.

And so on Thursday the prime minister was welcomed to the White House with the highest trappings of American friendship: Marching troops on the South Lawn, extensive Oval Office talks and a state dinner in the evening, complete with a chef who specializes in plant-based cuisine to accommodate Modi’s vegetarian diet.

“I’ve long believed the relationship between the United States and India … will be one of the defining relationships of the 21st century,” Biden said during an elaborate welcome ceremony during which he hailed the friendship between the US and India.

Modi takes reporters’ questions in remarkable moment

Later, when the two leaders held a joint news conference that had been subject of intense negotiations between American and Indian officials, it was only Biden who called on reporters.

But Modi, for one of the only times since he assumed power, also responded to a question about his crackdowns on dissent and treatment of religious minorities.

“There’s absolutely no space for discrimination,” Modi said through a translator. ‘When you talk of democracy, if there are no human values and there is no humanity, there are no human rights, then it’s not a democracy.”

It was a remarkable moment for a leader who rarely holds news conferences, takes questions from the press or sits for international interviews. Press freedom groups say he’s overseen a crackdown on reporting.

The format of the news conference was only agreed upon after lengthy, delicate negotiations between the two sides. Indian officials initially balked at the White House’s insistence at holding one, two US officials familiar with the matter said.

Biden, in his own answer on Modi’s human rights record, underscored the shared values between the US and India.

“The prime minister and I had a good discussion about democratic values,” he said. “That’s the nature of our relationship, we’re straightforward with each other and we respect each other.”

“I believe that we believe in the dignity of every citizen, and it is in American’s DNA, and I believe in India’s DNA,” the president told reporters Thursday, adding that the two countries’ commitment to democracy “makes us appealing partners and enables us to expand democratic institutions across around the world.”

An important international relationship

As he welcomed Modi to the White House earlier in the day, Biden sought to underscore the importance of shared values in the relationship moving forward.

“As democracies, we can better tap into the full talent of all of our people, and attract investments as true and trusted partners as leading nations, with our greatest export being the power of our example,” Biden said from a podium on the South Lawn. “Equity under the law, freedom of expression, religious pluralism and the diversity of our people. These core principles have endured and evolved even as they have faced challenges throughout each of our nation’s histories and fuel our strength, depth and future.”

The meetings Thursday produced agreements on technology and defense cooperation and highlighted Biden’s efforts to shore up relationships in a region grappling with an increasingly aggressive Beijing.

Also up for discussion was Russia’s continuing war in Ukraine, a conflict on which India has not taken a definitive side. New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil has helped prop up Moscow amid withering global sanctions.

“Fundamentally, we believe that the long-term trajectory of the US-India relationship is built on the notion that two democracies with shared value systems ought to be able to work together,” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told a group of reporters ahead of the visit.

“That’s a long view. That’s a view rooted in our bet on the relationship between the people of the United States of America and the people of India,” Sullivan continued. “Part of what will be lifted up and celebrated in this visit will be those deep people and people ties.”

Courting a controversial leader

Modi is hardly the first leader with authoritarian tendencies to be invited for a state visit at the White House. President Barack Obama hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015, shortly after he assumed power in Beijing.

And Biden is not the first president to embrace Modi. Alongside President Donald Trump, the Indian prime minister attended a massive “Howdy Modi” rally in Houston for members of the Indian diaspora. Modi returned the favor in Ahmedabad with a “Namaste Trump” event held in the world’s largest cricket stadium.

Other world leaders have offered a similar welcome. French President Emmanuel Macron will host Modi as the guest of honor at this year’s Bastille Day parade.

But Biden has made as a centerpiece of his foreign policy the battle between “democracy and autocracy,” a thematic backdrop perhaps nowhere more relevant than in India.

In March, the former leader of India’s main opposition political party, Rahul Gandhi, was disqualified as a lawmaker a day after he was handed a two-year jail sentence for defamation in a ruling his supporters called politically motivated.

Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has come under scrutiny from rights groups and opposition lawmakers for its increasingly strident brand of Hindu nationalist politics and an ongoing crackdown on dissent.

Modi himself was denied a visa to the United States in 2005 because of his alleged role in anti-Muslim violence three years earlier in Gujarat state, where he was chief minister. More than 1,000 people were killed, mostly Muslims. A Supreme Court-ordered investigation in India absolved him of blame.

A wide array of human rights groups, lawmakers and dissidents have made clear they want Biden to raise his concerns on Modi’s record when he’s at the White House. A group of more than 70 congressional Democrats wrote a letter to Biden this week urging him to bring up human rights concerns when he meets with Modi.

“You have once again made respect for human rights, press freedom, religious freedom, and pluralism core tenets of American foreign policy. Moreover, these tenets are necessary to the functioning of true democracy. In order to advance these values with credibility on the world stage, we must apply them equally to friend and foe alike, just as we work to apply these same principles here in the United States,” the lawmakers wrote.

The letter was spearheaded by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat. Jayapal said in a tweet about the letter, “We must ensure freedom of the press, religious tolerance, internet access, & the diversity of political thought.”

Six Democratic lawmakers boycotted Modi’s address to Congress Thursday. Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pointed before the address to Modi’s treatment of Muslims.

Grappling with China’s influence

Thursday’s state visit included announcements in the technology space as well as defense cooperation, including on defense sales, production and technology collaboration, an administration official said.

American defense trade with India had boomed in the past 15 years, and US officials have noted India is diversifying away from relying on any one nation, like Russia, for arms.

“You’ll see major cancellations of defense system purchases from Russia, in part because we know Russia can’t actually provide it, that Russia is consuming its own defense production very quickly in this terrible war in Ukraine,” a senior administration official said. “And everyone around the world who buys Russian equipment is worried about whether they can get spare parts and then new systems, given the supply chain problems that Russia is experiencing.”

Among the announcements Thursday was that India has committed to the purchase of MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones, deepening the two nations’ military ties amidst the backdrop of an increasingly bellicose China.

Biden and Modi planned an agreement between US manufacturer GE and the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics to jointly produce F414 jet engines in India.

Other announcements included India joining the US-led Artemis Accords, an international cooperative agreement for space exploration, mounting a joint-mission with NASA to the International Space Station in 2024 and a commitment from US-based semiconductor producer Micron Technology to break ground on a $2.75 billion new semiconductor assembly and test facility in India.

The discussions between the two men also touched on enhancing educational exchanges and were expected to feature new steps forward on visas and diplomatic presence in each country. They also discussed agenda issues for the G20 summit, which India is preparing to host in September.

Biden’s efforts to deepen ties with India comes as the two countries grapple with the growing influence of China. The president has met with Modi on several occasions, including through meetings of the Quad leaders.

He said at a fundraiser this week that his revival of the four-way alliance had upset Xi.

“He called me and told me not to do that because it was putting him in a bind,” Biden said, referring to the Chinese president. “We’re just trying to make sure the international rules of air and sea lanes remain open.”

Sullivan, however, said Thursday’s visit at the White House was “not about China,” though “the question of China’s role in the military domain, the technology domain, the economic domain will be on the agenda.”

35. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi reaffirmed their countries’ commitment to an open, secure, inclusive, safe, interoperable, and reliable Internet, and to continuing cooperation on a range of cybersecurity issues, including preventing and responding to cyber threats, promoting cybersecurity education and awareness and measures to build resilient cyber infrastructure. Both the United States and India are committed to sharing information about cyber threats and vulnerabilities, and to working together to investigate and respond to cyber incidents.



36. The United States and India reaffirm and embrace their shared values of freedom, democracy, human rights, inclusion, pluralism, and equal opportunities for all citizens. Both countries have a tradition of recognizing the diversity represented in their nations and celebrating the contributions of all their citizens. They reasserted that democracy, freedom, and rule of law are the shared values that anchor global peace and sustainable development. In keeping with the spirit of leaving no one behind, both leaders committed to working towards ensuring that fruits of economic growth and well-being reach the underprivileged. They also committed to pursue programs and initiatives that would facilitate women-led development, and enable all women and girls to live free from gender-based violence and abuse. President Biden underscored his appreciation for India’s participation in the Summit for Democracy process, and for efforts made by India toward sharing knowledge, technical expertise, and experiences with electoral management bodies of other democracies. The leaders also welcomed the re-launch of the Global Issues Forum, which would hold its next meeting at an appropriate time.



Propelling Global Growth



37. As two of the world’s largest democratic economies, the United States and India are indispensable partners in advancing global prosperity and a free, fair, and rules-based economic order. President Biden highlighted the impactful participation of Prime Minister Modi in the G7 Hiroshima Summit and looks forward to the G20 Summit in September in New Delhi. He applauded India’s leadership in its ongoing G20 Presidency, which has brought renewed focus on strengthening multilateral institutions and international cooperation to tackle global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, fragility and conflict, along with work to accelerate achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and lay the foundation for strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.



38. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi are united in their determination to use the G20 to deliver on shared priorities for the G20 Leaders’ Summit, including improving the sovereign debt restructuring process; advancing the multilateral development bank evolution agenda, including mobilizing new concessional financing at the World Bank to support all developing countries; and raising the level of ambition on mobilizing private sector investment for quality, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure, including through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. The United States looks forward to hosting the G20 presidency in 2026, nearly two decades after the first full-scale G20 Leaders’ Summit in Pittsburgh.



39. The United States and India recognize the potential of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) approaches for enabling open and inclusive digital economies. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi intend to work together to provide global leadership for the implementation of DPI to promote inclusive development, competitive markets, and protect individual rights. In this regard, the United States and India will explore how to partner together and align our efforts to advance the development and deployment of robust DPIs, including appropriate safeguards to protect, privacy, data security and intellectual property. They will explore developing a U.S.-India Global Digital Development Partnership, which would bring together technology and resources from both countries to enable development and deployment of DPIs in developing countries.



40. The leaders are committed to pursuing ambitious efforts to strengthen Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to address shared global challenges of the 21st century. In this regard, they emphasized the need for comprehensive efforts by MDBs to evolve their vision, incentive structure, operational approaches and financial capacity so that they are better equipped to address a wide range of SDGs and trans-boundary challenges including climate change, pandemics, conflicts and fragility. Recognizing multilateral efforts in this area, the leaders acknowledged the ongoing work under the Indian presidency of the G20 on strengthening MDBs including the report of the G20 Expert Group on Strengthening MDBs. By the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi, the United States and India will work together to secure G20 commitment to create a major new dedicated pool of funds at the World Bank to deploy concessional lending for global challenges, and to enhance support for crisis response in International Development Association recipient countries.



41. The leaders reaffirmed that the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) is an important pillar of our collective and collaborative efforts to build resilience in our supply chains, harness transformations in clean energy, and accelerate progress of our economies through anti-corruption efforts, efficient tax administrative practices, and capacity building measures. The leaders welcomed the substantial conclusion of negotiations on the proposed IPEF Supply Chain Agreement and committed to working with other partners expeditiously to conclude negotiations of the agreements under the clean economy and fair economy pillars to deliver concrete benefits that enhance the economic competitiveness and prosperity of countries in the Indo-Pacific. President Biden invited India to attend the APEC Summit in San Francisco in November 2023 as a guest of the host.



42. The U.S.-India trade and investment partnership is an engine for global growth, with bilateral trade exceeding $191 billion in 2022, nearly doubling from 2014. The leaders applauded the reconvening of the U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue and CEO Forum in March in New Delhi. They encouraged respective industries to take action on the recommendations from the CEOs for greater engagement and technical cooperation to build resilient supply chains for emerging technologies, clean energy technologies, and pharmaceuticals; promote an innovative digital economy; lower barriers to trade and investment; harmonize standards and regulations wherever feasible; and work towards skilling our workforces. The leaders support continued active engagement between the U.S. Treasury Department and the Indian Ministry of Finance under the Economic and Financial Partnership dialogue. They encouraged the U.S. Federal Insurance Office and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India to advance areas of mutual interest in the insurance sector under their existing MoU framework.



43. The United States and India have also taken steps toward deepening bilateral cooperation to strengthen our economic relationship, including trade ties. Underscoring the willingness and trust of both countries in resolving trade issues, the leaders welcomed the resolution of six outstanding WTO disputes between the two countries through mutually agreed solutions as well as their understandings on market access related to certain products of significance to the bilateral trade relationship. They also looked forward to reconvening the India-U.S. Trade Policy Forum before the end of 2023 to further enhance the bilateral trade relationship by addressing trade concerns and identifying further areas for engagement. India highlighted its interest in the restoration of its status under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences program, which could be considered in relation to eligibility criteria determined by the U.S. Congress. The leaders supported intensifying the work to advance progress on issues related to the eligibility criteria. Prime Minister Modi also expressed India’s interest towards being recognized as a Trade Agreements Act-designated country by the United States to further enhance the integration of both economies and to further promote trade and investment between two countries. In this regard, the leaders welcomed the initiation of discussions between both sides at an official level on issues related to bilateral government procurement.



44. The leaders welcomed focused efforts under the re-launched U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue to expand cooperation in the areas of Talent, Innovation, and Inclusive Growth. President Biden expressed appreciation for the significant workforce development efforts undertaken by several of the Indian companies taking part in the U.S.-India CEO Forum to upskill more than 250,000 employees and promote STEM learning within local communities across the United States. Both leaders applauded the concept of an “Innovation Handshake” under the Commercial Dialogue that will lift up and connect the two sides’ dynamic startup ecosystems, address specific regulatory hurdles to cooperation, and promote further innovation and job growth, particularly in emerging technologies. The Innovation Handshake demonstrates the resolve on both sides to further bolster their shared vision of an elevated strategic technology partnership, leveraging the strength and ingenuity of their respective private sectors to identify new innovations and match them with industry requirements across the priority sectors identified under the iCET framework.



45. Recognizing the essential role that micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) play in advancing inclusive growth, expanding exports, and boosting employment across our respective cities, towns, and rural areas, the leaders welcomed plans under the Commercial Dialogue to organize a forum to promote the role and scope of MSMEs in bilateral trade and a digital commerce showcase to strengthen the engagement of women-owned and rural enterprises in particular. They commended the work of the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Indian Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, which are pursuing increased cooperation and intend to formalize their work through a MoU to support entrepreneurs and MSMEs.



46. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi again welcomed Air India’s historic agreement with Boeing to acquire more than 200 American-made aircraft. This purchase will support more than one million American jobs across 44 states and contribute to ongoing efforts to modernize the civil aviation sector in India. Boeing has announced a $100 million investment on infrastructure and programs to train pilots in India, supporting India’s need for 31,000 new pilots over the next 20 years. The leaders also welcomed Boeing’s announcement of its completion of a C-17 aftermarket support facility for MRO and a new parts logistics center in India to capture future synergies between defense and civil aviation.



Empowering Future Generations and Protecting the Health of our People



47. President Biden and Prime Minister hailed the growing bilateral education partnership between the United States and India. Indian students are on pace to soon become the largest foreign student community in the United States, with an increase of nearly 20 percent in Indian students studying in the United States last year alone. The leaders welcomed the establishment of a new Joint Task Force of the Association of American Universities and leading Indian educational institutions, including the Indian Institutes of Technology, and the nomination of councils on each side, and noted their interim recommendations for expanding research and university partnerships between the two countries. They also welcomed the establishment of Indo-U.S. Global Challenge Institutes to spark deeper research partnerships and people-to-people exchanges between a range of diverse institutions in the U.S. and India in semiconductors, sustainable agriculture, clean energy, health and pandemic preparedness, and emerging technologies.



48. The leaders welcomed an announcement by the U.S. Department of State that it would launch a pilot to adjudicate domestic renewals of certain petition-based temporary work visas later this year, including for Indian nationals, with the intent to implement this for an expanded pool of H1B and L visa holders in 2024 and eventually broadening the program to include other eligible categories.



49. The leaders affirmed that the movement of professional and skilled workers, students, investors and business travelers between the countries contributes immensely to enhancing bilateral economic and technological partnership. While acknowledging the important steps taken to augment processing of visa applications, they noted the pressing need to further expedite this process. The leaders also directed officials to identify additional mechanisms to facilitate travel for business, tourism, and professional and technical exchanges between the two countries.



50. Concomitant with the rapid growth in our strategic partnership and demand for travel, both sides intend to open new consulates in each other’s countries. The United States intends to initiate the process to open two new consulates in India in the cities of Bengaluru and Ahmedabad. India will take steps to operationalize its new consulate in Seattle later this year, and open two new consulates at jointly identified locations in the United States.



51. The leaders recognized the role of asocial security totalization agreement in protecting the interests of cross border workers and reaffirmed the intent to continue ongoing discussions concerning the elements required in both countries to enter into a bilateral social security totalization agreement.



52. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi celebrate the historic and active collaboration across the full expanse of our respective health sectors. They welcomed the opportunity for deeper collaboration to secure pharmaceutical supply chains. The leaders encouraged their administrations to continue their strong collaboration on pandemic preparedness, supported by epidemiology training; laboratory strengthening and point of entry surveillance; and food safety and regulation. The leaders applauded collaborations between research institutes of both countries on affordable cancer technology programs, including for the development of AI enabled diagnostic and prognosis prediction tools, and on diabetes research. The leaders committed to holding a U.S.-India Cancer Dialogue, hosted by President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot, to bring experts together from both countries to identify concrete areas of collaboration to accelerate the rate of progress against cancer. They also called for expanded collaboration on digital health platforms including responsible use of cutting-edge technologies like AI, and to explore cooperation in research and the use of traditional medicine. President Biden lauded Prime Minister Modi’s plan to eliminate tuberculosis in India by 2025, five years ahead of the target set by the UN’s sustainable development goals, hailing it as a big step forward that will inspire other countries to action.



53. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi welcomed the opportunity for deeper collaboration to secure, de-risk, and strengthen pharmaceutical supply chains, with a focus on active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials, and key vaccine input materials. They also underscored the need for strengthening global collaboration network on research and development in medical countermeasures, vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to promote access to safe, effective, and innovative medical products in an affordable manner.



54. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi committed to work toward a broader and deeper bilateral drug policy framework for the 21st century. Under this framework, both countries aspire to expand cooperation and collaboration to disrupt the illicit production and international trafficking of illicit drugs, including synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl and Amphetamine Type Stimulants and illicit use of their Precursors. Toward this end, they committed to a holistic public health partnership to prevent and treat illicit drug use, address workforce shortages and skilling requirements, and showcase a secure, resilient, reliable and growing pharmaceutical supply chain as a model for the world.



55. Prime Minister Modi conveyed his deep appreciation for the repatriation of antiquities to India by the United States. Both sides expressed strong interest in working quickly toward a Cultural Property Agreement, which would help to prevent illegal trafficking of cultural property from India and enhance cooperation on the protection and lawful exchange of cultural property.



56. The Leaders welcomed the establishment of the Tamil Studies Chair at the University of Houston and reinstating the Vivekananda Chair at the University of Chicago to further research and teaching of India’s history and culture.



57. Prime Minister Modi looked forward to the visit of President Biden to the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi in September 2023.



58. Taken together, the leaders today affirmed that this document, in its breadth and depth, represents the most expansive and comprehensive vision for progress in the history of our bilateral relationship. Still, our ambitions are to reach ever greater heights, and we commit both our governments and our peoples to this endeavor, now and into the future.

236,https://thewire.in/diplomacy/narendra-modis-first-state-visit-to-the-us-has-both-national-and-global-implications,Narendra Modi's First State Visit to the US Has Both National and Global Implications,,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first state visit to the United States from June 21 to June 24 is generating a great deal of interest for its geopolitical significance. While Modi has been invited for several bilateral and multilateral meetings with American presidents in the past, this official state visit, preceding the G20 Summit in September, with a state dinner, is a signal that the US considers India to be an equal partner.

In a statement, the White House said that the state visit, the highest level of diplomatic reception, will boost the US and India’s “shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific”.

Indeed, the visit is important as the US seeks to counter China’s growing clout and look to possibly move its investments. Political scientist Sumit Ganguly said, “The [Joe] Biden administration is desperately courting India – they need a potential counterweight to China, for global supply chain and for investment reasons.” It could also provide an opportunity for the US to urge India, which so far has been walking a fine line, to openly condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

The visit is also crucial for Modi’s global image and, more importantly, for buttressing an image back home, as part of his 2024 election campaign launch – of India’s global grandstanding (notwithstanding the human rights violations) – and in particular of Modi as the leader who achieved that.

As part of the plan to extend a grand welcome to Modi, the American-Indian diaspora is planning events in multiple cities. An ‘India Unity Day’ march is being planned from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC; other such marches are being planned in 20 other prominent cities, including New York’s Times Square and San Francisco’s Golden Bridge. Additionally, according to news reports, the Indian diaspora has planned “a cultural event spanning Kashmir to Kanyakumari, and West to East in front of the White House”, to showcase the growth of India during Modi’s term of the past nine years. It is also likely that Modi may lead the International Yoga Day celebrations on June 21 in New York.

Experts caution against viewing the 2.8 million strong Indian diaspora as a monolith. According to political scientist Latha Varadarajan, who is the author of a book The Domestic Abroad, it is a “particular kind of Indian abroad that speaks loudly, who represent specific socio economic interests”. Their views, she explains, are closely tied to their economic interests: they support the opening of Indian markets and show “a strong support for corporate friendly policies adopted by the Modi government”.

The events for Modi’s welcome are being planned by the Overseas Friends of BJP (OFBJP) USA, along with other right-wing organisations such as the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh, which has been fast expanding in many countries across the world, with branches currently in about 40 countries including East Asia. The HSS has some 205 local chapters in the US and presence on many college campuses.

The OFBJP has been very influential in organising fundraising and other pro-Modi events. Prior to the last general election, the group organised hundreds of “chai pe charcha (chat over tea)” events, as a way to influence potential voters. They do fundraising and also work as unofficial pollsters. They call friends and family back home, and urge them to vote for Modi, explains Varadarajan.

The same group was involved in events like Modi’s at New York’s Madison Square Garden in 2014 and “Howdy Modi” in Texas featuring Modi and Donald Trump in 2019. These events brought hundreds and thousands of people who chanted Modi’s name. Over 19,000 people attended the Madison Square Garden event. And a crowd of over 50,000 people was present when Modi and Trump jointly addressed the ‘Howdy Modi!’ gathering in Houston, Texas.

While exact numbers are hard to come by, such events help with fundraising for the party. The group, along with other Hindu nationalist organisations, has been pivotal in providing support and funding to the BJP. Scholar Fahmida Ashraf has conducted research on several charities that channel funding to the BJP.

Diaspora diplomacy has been a key part of Modi’s political strategy since the time he was chief minister of Gujarat. He has attended various events organised by the Gujarati community, who represent the largest group among the Indian Americans. When Modi was refused a visa in 2005, he had been invited to attend the Annual Convention and Trade Show of the Asian American Hotel Owners Association in Florida.

Support also comes from those in the diaspora who want to project a strong Indian state to the western world, while ignoring the human rights violations, the suppression of freedom of speech and attacks on minorities. As Ganguly explains, there are those in the diaspora who “seem to put a great deal of emphasis on restoring India’s pride and Modi has played up that narrative effectively and many are willing to overlook India’s shortcomings” in this process.

The visit will serve to likely enhance Modi’s image both abroad and at home. The Indian state would like to present itself “as a spokesperson for the global South – as a state that challenges what it calls western bullying,” says Varadarajan. The state dinner hosted by Biden will send out a signal that the US and India are equal allies.

Modi calls India the “mother of democracy” and Biden refers to India as the “world’s largest democracy”. However, experts caution that ignoring human rights violations may erode the very idea of what constitutes a true democracy.

237,https://scroll.in/article/1051464/modi-in-washington-us-media-highlights-democracy-debate-indian-media-focuses-on-pageantry,"Modi in Washington: US media highlights democracy debate, Indian media focuses on pageantry",,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to the United States this week was covered by news media from both countries with a contrast.

Beyond the usual reporting on bilateral agreements being signed, the American news media generally focused on the alleged democratic backsliding in India under the Modi government and its possible impact on Delhi and Washington’s bilateral relations.

However, in contrast, most of the Indian media largely focused on the pageantry during Modi’s visit.

American media coverage

The state visit, considered the United States’ highest expression of bilateral relations with any country, assumed significance because both the United States and India now have a common rival: China.

Even before Modi embarked on this state visit, American news media had published opinions and expert commentary about the alleged attack on human rights in India under Modi. This, they highlighted, had led to a tricky situation for Biden who has projected the two nations’ shared democratic values as the basis for their bilateral relationship.

During Modi’s visit, the United States’ news organisations extended their focus to the business aspects of Modi’s visit to highlight Delhi’s utility for Washington as a geopolitical counterweight to China. On Thursday, for example, American news media widely reported on the military drone procurement and the fighter jet engine production deal between the two countries.

However, the United States’ media organisations such as The Washington Post also continued to report on how Modi’s visit was putting Biden’s “democracy-vs-autocracy pitch” under pressure. Some other outlets similarly reported how Biden was emphasising on Delhi and Washington’s common interest areas and “publicly skirting points of friction” such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and “crackdown on human rights” in India to ensure the visit’s success.

Additionally, as compared to their Indian counterparts, the American news media reported more prominently about half a dozen United States’ lawmakers boycotting Modi’s address to the joint session of the United States Congress, the country’s federal legislature. The boycott was to protest what they allege is Modi’s poor human rights record, particularly toward minorities in India.

Some American news outlets such as NBC News also reported how Modi’s visit had highlighted the “deep divide” within the United States’ Indian diaspora over the allegedly poor human rights record of the Modi government. Similarly, on Thursday, The New York Times reported how groups critical of Modi’s treatment of minorities were protesting outside the White House, even as Biden hosted the state dinner inside.

Just sat down for an exclusive w/ President @BarackObama in Athens to discuss the future of democracy, at home & abroad. I asked how the US should engage with autocracies. Watch his response.

Indian media coverage

However, in contrast, beyond the usual coverage of the bilateral agreements being signed, much of the Indian news media was largely focussed on the pageantry of Modi’s visit. They largely steering clear of reporting on the alleged democratic backsliding in India being a possible hurdle in strengthening of the India-US bilateral ties.

Instead, on Friday, several Indian news websites and pro-Modi government portals reported about how many times Modi had received a standing ovation while addressing the joint session of the United States Congress. It is a long-standing custom for the US Congress’ members to give a standing ovation to whoever addresses the joint session, including foreign leaders.

#WATCH | ""He (PM Narendra Modi) had not just one standing ovation, I think he had 8 or 10 standing ovations. I think I lost count...Great rousing speech, it was very popularly received and he came across as very warm and genuine..,"" says Congressman Rich McCormick pic.twitter.com/NPwENQ9bn0 — ANI (@ANI) June 22, 2023

Similarly, “Modi, Modi” and “Vande Mataram” slogans being raised in the legislature during the Indian prime minister’s address was widely reported.

Additionally, the Indian news media reported extensively about the gifts Modi and Biden exchanged on behalf of the two countries. Similarly, the menu of the state dinner Biden hosted for Modi at the White House on Thursday was the subject of several Indian news stories. However, some American news outlets also reported on the menu.

Moreover, contrary to the United States’ media reporting about different diaspora groups rallying in favour of and against Modi, Indian news media widely reported about groups supporting Modi that had gathered in Washington to welcome him.

Meanwhile, Modi’s response to a question posed by an American journalist on rights of Muslims and other minorities in India, made it to the front pages of Indian newspapers and was widely reported online. Modi was asked the question at a rare press conference with Biden on Thursday. In contrast, Modi taking the question in the press conference was reported prominently by only some United States news organisations such as CNN."

The 75th session of the UNGA in 2020 was washed out by the Covid pandemic. This year, though, the 76th UNGA afforded a chance for assorted leaders — Prime Ministers, Presidents, Emirs, Sheikhs — and assorted rulers to descend on America, to be seen, photographed, heard and video-taped, and to meet, if they could get an audience, with the new White House team of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

For India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was a much awaited and long anticipated return to some semblance of a pre-Covid level frenetic globe-trotting, sans the tight embrace, bon-homie style that led to the term “hugplomacy”.

But how did it go for Team Modi?

Well, on the face of it, it is hard to see how it could have been anything other than a success given that the official press release that contained the PMO’s own statement before the trip made it clear that expectations were modest. It was to “review” the strategic partnership, “exchange” views with the US leadership, “take stock” with QUAD partners, “consolidate” relations with partners, and “address” the UN. In short, it was all a pro-forma process with no pre-defined outcomes.

The media reactions to the visit and its aftermath followed the usual playbook. Republic TV made it sound like Modi was the only foreign dignitary to speak at the UNGA. Zee News ran with silly stories of “Josh high in Washington,” and breathless accounts of a grand welcome home. Aaj Tak was keen to emphasise how this trip had many firsts. Times Now presented it as a pivotal geopolitical moment .

If these were the only news channels you watched you’d think this was it — the grand State Visit that was going to solve every world problem from climate change to China to poverty to international conflict.

But how did other players respond? And how did the media, especially sections of social media, view it all?

Even as the Indian Prime Minister’s brand new 4,500 Crore Rupees Air India One Boeing was taking off from Delhi, the voices of human rights and religious freedoms were telling the US President’s team the issues he should take up with his Indian counterpart. On 22 September in a 90-minute webinar , under the “Congressional briefings” banner chaired by John Prabhudoss (from the Federation of Indian American Christian Organisations ), a call went out to the the White House and leaders of the US Congress to take the opportunity of the visit by Prime Minister Modi to impress upon him the need for the Indian Government to take urgent steps to protect human and civil rights and promote religious freedoms.

At the webinar, Nadine Maenza, Chair of the US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), reminded the audience of the recommendation of the Commission in two annual reports to the US State Department to regard India as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) in relation to religious freedoms. She referred her audience to Prof Angana Chatterji’s report on the situation in Assam, entitled “BREAKING WORLDS: Religion, Law and Citizenship in Majoritarian India: The Story of Assam” — a report dated September 2, which was almost prescient in light of recent events in that troubled State.

Govind Acharya of Amnesty International USA, Angna Chatterji of UC Berkeley, and Harsh Mander , currently a Fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy, and John Sifton, Asia Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch (a copy of his testimony is here ) also spoke in the webinar.

The broad but pointed message of this panel to the US team was that it was incumbent upon the Biden White House to impress upon the Indian side that a strong and stable strategic partnership can only be sustained by respect for human rights; space for the democratic values of free speech, press freedoms, and the rule of law; and the promotion of religious freedoms of minorities.

The leader of the Farmers protest, Rakesh Tikait tweeted an “open letter” to President Biden to intercede with his Indian counterpart on behalf of the agitating farmers.

The meeting at the White House with Vice-President Kamala Harris invited social media attention for the VP’s pointed mention of the importance of democratic values in both countries.

“As democracies around the world are under threat, it is imperative that we defend democratic principles and institutions within our countries. We must strengthen democracy at home and it is incumbent upon us that we protect democracy in the best interest of our people,” she said. Note that the Biden-Harris White House took charge at a particularly traumatic time because of the attempted insurrection and the dramatically violent assault on the very heart of US democracy.

The Prime Minister's meeting with President Joe Biden was a relatively tame affair with the President jocularly praising , almost tongue-in-cheek, the Indian journalists for being “well-behaved”.

Some things do not change. Even in 2019, PM Modi’s visit was presented as a major world event and a huge success but only by the Indian media for their audience back home, but it barely registered as a footnote in the US media. Then too, as Shoaib Danyal put it , “jingoism took precedence over factual reporting about the UN session”. There was barely a mention of the Modi visit in the US media save a brief mention in the context of the QUAD meeting, much to the surprise of Aaj Tak anchor Anjana Om Kashyap who tried flicking through a selection of US papers on air to spot coverage of the Modi visit.

Indeed very few Indian media outlets, if any at all, took the trouble to research what the 76th UNGA was about, and what the stand was of the other world leaders who also addressed the General Assembly. A cursory search on Google would have led even a rookie journalist to a wealth of information about the agenda, background papers, and issues before the UN.

Instead they focused exclusively and breathlessly on the 20-minute long address by PM Modi on September 25. The speech itself was as might have been expected. It sounded like a robust and combative defense of the Indian Government’s record in office in the last seven years; set against a backdrop of statements about India as an ancient democratic civilisation that inherently valued diversity, individual freedom, development, trade, openness and peace.

There was the obligatory reference to terrorism, of course, and how a certain neighbour sought to rely on terrorism rather than development to further its political aims.

Speaking in Hindi with instantaneous translation by the UN team into several languages, Modi’s speech at the UN was not the eagerly anticipated address that Indian media channels would have you believe. It was left to social media and Twitter handles to point out the preponderance of vacant seats in the assembly Hall

In the final analysis, it depends very much on the newspaper you read or the TV news you watch to get a feel for how important or influential the Indian PM’s visit to the US was. Perhaps, the truth is somewhere between the breathless fawning coverage of the TV channels that are beholden to the Government for its largesse and the somewhat cynical view expressed in this tweet thread.

Such visits by the head of the country’s government to gatherings of major world leaders are important and necessary, even if not essential — because not to make the effort to travel and be seen would be an own goal. But part of the magic is to manage expectations, say the right things at the right time, but to do so in an understated manner that does not make the audience cynical. But perhaps the most important thing is to be accessible to the world’s press.

This visit to the United States was the 6th by Mr Modi. And while there were many ‘firsts’ that his supporters claimed for it, regrettably it was not the first foreign trip in which the Indian Prime Minister gave a press conference."

During the meeting, the US Secretaries provided PM Modi with a comprehensive overview of their discussions with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar under the ‘2+2’ framework.

The briefings covered diverse aspects of bilateral collaboration, ranging from defence and semiconductors to emerging technologies, space, and health.

These discussions were framed within the context of Prime Minister Modi’s State visit to the US in June 2023 and his subsequent meeting with US leaders on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in New Delhi.

Expressing contentment at the expanding cooperation across various domains, PM Modi underscored that the comprehensive global strategic partnership rests on shared values of democracy, pluralism, and a commitment to the rule of law.

The leaders also exchanged views on pressing regional and global matters, with a particular focus on the evolving developments in West Asia.

Emphasising the importance of sustained close coordination between India and the US, they explored avenues for joint action on these critical issues.

PM Modi took the opportunity to convey warm greetings to President Biden, expressing anticipation for ongoing exchanges between the two nations.

245,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-indias-prime-minister-modi-delivers-remarks-at-joint-meeting-of-congress,WATCH: India’s Prime Minister Modi delivers remarks at joint meeting of Congress,2023-06-22 12:35:09-05:00,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Thursday pronounced the U.S.-India relationship never stronger and rolled out new business deals with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as human rights activists and American lawmakers questioned the administration’s decision to honor the leader with a pomp-filled state visit.

Watch Modi’s remarks in the player above.

In a joint news conference with Modi, Biden called the relationship between the U.S. and India among the most consequential in the world and “more dynamic than at any time in history.” He underscored how two of the world’s most powerful democracies were cooperating on issues such as the climate, health care and space, saying that the U.S-India economic relationship was “booming.”

But Modi bristled at a reporter’s question about his country’s commitment to democratic values as the country has seen an erosion of religious, political and press freedoms under his watch.

“Democracy is our spirit,” Modi, who rarely takes questions from journalists, said through an interpreter. “Democracy runs in our veins. We live democracy and our ancestors have actually put words to this concept.” He said India has “proved that democracies can deliver and when I say deliver, this is regardless of class, creed, religion, gender.”

Yet Modi has faced criticism over legislation amending the country’s citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalization for some migrants but excludes Muslims, a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists, and the recent conviction of India’s top opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modi’s surname.

Nevertheless, later in an address before a joint meeting of Congress, Modi insisted that in India “diversity is a natural way of life.”

“We are home to all faiths in the world, and we celebrate all of them,” added Modi, in a line that brought many cheering lawmakers to their feet.

WATCH: Biden and Indian Prime Minister Modi hold joint news briefing during state visit to U.S.

The premier’s description runs counter to accusations by rights groups of widespread attacks and discrimination against India’s Muslims and other minorities under Modi.

A group of more than 70 lawmakers wrote to Biden this week urging him to raise concerns about the erosion of religious, press and political freedoms during the visit. At least six Democratic lawmakers —Democratic Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Greg Casar of Texas, Jamaal Bowman and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — boycotted Modi’s address to Congress, because of concerns about his human rights records.

“When it comes to standing up for human rights, actions speak louder than words,” Bush, Tlaib, Omar and Bowman said in a joint statement. “By bestowing Prime Minister Modi with the rare honor of a joint address, Congress undermines its ability to be a credible advocate for the rights of religious minorities and journalists around the world.”

Standing alongside Modi, Biden emphasized that press, religious and other fundamental freedoms should be at the core of how both democracies operate. During their Oval Office meeting, Biden said, he and Modi had a “good discussion about democratic values” while Modi said “there’s absolutely no space for discrimination” when pressed about his own commitment on human rights.

The state visit, just the third of the Biden’s presidency, was certainly a glitzy affair.

Thousands gathered on the White House South Lawn for the welcoming ceremony, listening to performances by violinist Vibha Janakiraman and the a cappella group Penn Masala. As Modi arrived, the crowd — including many members of the Indian diaspora — broke out in a chant of “Modi, Modi, Modi.”

“All eyes are on the two largest democracies in the world, India and America,” Modi said. “I believe that our strategic partnership is important. I’m confident that working together will be successful.”

Later, Modi told Congress that “our partnership augurs well for the future of democracy” as the two countries expand partnerships in defense, semiconductor manufacturing and other industries. He also cheered the “samosa caucus”—the six U.S. House members of Indian descent—and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is Black and of Indian descent, as examples of the impact of the diaspora.

Said Biden: “Since I’ve become president, we’ve continued to build a relationship built on mutual trust, candor and respect.”

Biden administration officials say honoring Modi, the leader of the conservative Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is Diplomacy 101. The U.S.-India relationship will be vital in coming decades as both sides navigate an ascendant China and the enormity of climate change, artificial intelligence, supply chain resilience and other issues.

“On the issues that matter most that will define the future, our nations look to one another including on critical regional and global issues,” Biden said.

Among the announcements made Thursday is an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.

The Biden administration also is coming out with plans to bolster India’s semiconductor industry. U.S.-based Micron Technology has agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending $800 million and India financing the rest. U.S.-based Applied Materials is announcing it will launch a new semiconductor center for commercialization and innovation in India, and Lam Research, another semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will start a training program for 60,000 Indian engineers.

On the space front, India will sign on to the the Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space exploration cooperation among nations participating in NASA’s lunar exploration plans. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station next year.

“We made critical and emerging technologies the pillar of our next generation partnership to ensure these technologies promote and protect our values, remain open, accessible, trusted and secure,” Biden added. “All this matters for America, for India and for the world.”

At the welcoming ceremony, Modi called the Indian diaspora in America — the millions of immigrants and their children from the subcontinent living in the U.S. — “the real strength” of the U.S.-India relationship. He said the honor of a formal state visit — the first in the U.S. for India since Barack Obama honored Modi’s predecessor, Manmohan Singh, in 2009 — reflected the positive impact Indians are having worldwide.

Modi, the son of a tea seller who rose to be India’s premier, also recalled that the first time he visited the White House was three decades ago as a “common man.”

“I have come here many times but today for the first time, the doors of the White House have been opened for the Indian American community in such large numbers,” Modi said to an estimated crowd of 7,000.

Despite the major deals, the visit was shadowed by concerns laid out by rights activists and lawmakers who question Modi’s commitment to democratic principles.

In 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi’s visa to the U.S., citing concerns that, as chief minister of the state of Gujarat, he did not act to stop communal violence during 2002 anti-Muslim riots that left more than 1,000 people dead. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.

Biden and Modi have also had differences over Russia’s war in Ukraine. India abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and refused to join the global coalition against Russia. Since the start of the war, the Modi government has also dramatically increased its purchase of Russian oil.

EXPLAINER: Here’s what to know about India’s ties with Russia

White House officials note that there are signs of change in India’s relationship with Russia, which has long been New Delhi’s biggest defense supplier.

India is moving away from Russian military equipment, looking more to the U.S., Israel, Britain and other nations. Modi recently met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and has spoken out about his worries about the potential use of nuclear weapons by Russia.

Modi, before Congress, said the war is “causing great pain” in Ukraine and having residual effects on Europe and beyond.

“This is not an era of war, but it is one of dialogue and diplomacy” Modi said. “And we must all do what we can to stop the bloodshed and human suffering.”

Without specifically naming China, Modi also addressed heightened tensions in the region, saying “dark clouds of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo Pacific.”

Later Thursday, Modi is to attend a lavish White House state dinner in his honor.

In his remarks, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the two countries are deepening their people to people ties. “…We’re harnessing together the power of innovation to make our economies more resilient and to make our communities more secure while expanding inclusive economic opportunity.

That’s evident in the cooperation on semiconductors and advanced biotechnology, on our unprecedented investments in deploying clean energy at scale in our countries as well as across the region, and our joint research and exploration projects in space” Secretary Blinken said.

“Finally, we’re deepening the remarkable ties between our people, which is really at the heart of everything. Exploring new educational exchanges, even building steps to facilitate travel between our countries, reducing VISA wait times…When Indians and Americans study together, work together, and collaborate together, the possibilities for progress are infinite” Secretary Blinken added.

At the '2+2' dialogue, Singh, Jaishankar, Austin and Blinken held extensive deliberations to take forward the India-US global strategic partnership.

258,http://www.ipcs.org/issue_select.php?recNo=575,Indo-US Relations: After Narendra Modi’s Visit,,"Indo-US Relations: After Narendra Modi’s Visit

Vivek Mishra · 01 Nov, 2014 · 257 · Issue Brief

The new government in New Delhi provides the US and India the chance to press the reset button and turn “areas of contention into areas of collaboration,” to quote a US official. However this approach is not going to be easy. Both governments will have to walk a tight rope in securing political and economic confidence while making certain compromises. However, there has been a breakthrough with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to the US. The challenge now is to consolidate this breakthrough.

The bilateral relationship got a new direction after the July 2009 joint statement by the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Government of India highlighting the areas that the two countries would focus on. The bilateral relationship rode on immense confidence in the aftermath of the framework agreement of the Indo-US Civil Nuclear Deal for at least more than half a decade.

With a new government at the helm, and with Narendra Modi having made the first crucial visit, it is opportune to analyse and prioritise the issues that are current or potential opportunities and roadblocks in the bilateral relationship. Such a perspective assumes importance vis-à-vis the 2013 diplomatic row between New Delhi and Washington, when many thought the government-to-government relations had reached its nadir. It was certainly a setback that brought the mutual relationship and confidence to a halt. Resultantly, there has been a limbo in many areas of mutual partnership, including the defence and trade sectors that have formed the bedrock of the bilateral relations for some time now. With the recent developments, the diplomatic row of 2013 now seems to be history.

In the middle of this tumultuous diplomatic phase, Washington seems to have made a conscious effort to establish good diplomatic faith with New Delhi. The US took a big step in asking one of its most experienced and senior diplomats to step aside in the interest of better relations with India. Modi’s promise that he would not let the history of his personal equations with the US get in the way of better bilateral relations was another mature political enunciation.

During his visit to the US, Modi not only delivered on the above expectations and promises but also took them forward in a smooth way. One of the compelling factors that drove Modi’s visit to the US was the intention to get the economy on a resurgent path by wooing investors. It was the result of this intention that on the eve of his visit, his government put forward the pitch, “Come, make in India.” In essence, Modi’s visit was hinged on two prospective rationales: wooing investors to India and providing momentum to bilateral defence cooperation, which has virtually been on a standstill for some time. The general warmth in the US reception of Modi went a long way in putting behind the tumultuous diplomatic row of the recent past. In what was an unprecedented step, the release of the joint vision statement called “Chalein saath, saath: Forward together we go” was a crucial step. This vision document is being seen as a new agenda that will allow the two countries to find ways to expand collaboration in trade, investment and technology. Sealing the intention of a cooperative framework between the two countries being adopted was the joint editorial in a US newspaper where Obama and Modi together resolved that “Our natural and unique partnership can help shape international security and peace for years to come.”

Trade/Economic Issues

To quote Nisha Desai Biswal, Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, “""Our collaboration on energy, science and technology, environment, space, education and counterterrorism continues to deepen."" Indo-US bilateral trade has been a driving factor, even as economic interdependence continues to grow. Both sides expect the larger bilateral relationship to hinge on economic and commercial relations. Investment and trade flows will define the limits of the relationship. During Modi’s visit, he and Obama pledged to deepen economic cooperation by setting a five-fold jump in Indo-US trade to US$500 billion. The collaboration in setting up a joint programme to boost business investment is also a welcome initiative.

In the sixth session of the US-India East Asia Consultations, a State Department spokesperson said, ""The delegations exchanged views on a variety of issues including maritime security, combating nuclear proliferation, and expanding regional trade opportunities in the Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor and beyond."" This approach is backed by the realisation that India has emerged as a dominant actor in the region and can be counted as the only credible counter-balance to China.

The regional stakes for India have increased with the Modi government’s focus on its neighbourhood. The expansion of regional trade could be a part of the government’s agenda in a big way. Expansion of trade will necessitate its protection through cooperation in maritime security. Taking forward the promise of the last government, the Modi government cleared a US$100 million line of credit to Vietnam for four patrol boats. These boats are likely to be used for trade and coastal security by Vietnam and hence fall under India’s strategic investments. Apart from these, one of the defining characteristics of this government has been improving regional cooperation by boosting trade and laying emphasis on the transition from Look East Policy to Act East Policy. In this regard, Japan’s commitment to double its current investment in India to US$35 billion over the next five years along with substantial Chinese investments is a win-win situation for India. Besides, Modi’s ten-day three-nation tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji shows that his administration takes Act East policy seriously with an understanding that small countries are also crucial. The US is a resident power in the Asia Pacific and India’s cooperation with its eastern and extended neighbours will also require a tacit understanding with the US in this region.

Defence Trade

According to reports, the US has overtaken Russia as the largest arms supplier to India in the last three years. The US stsnds first, followed by Russia, France and Israel.

Indo-US defence relations are largely poised on trade in defence, comprising mainly of imports from the latter to the former. Towards the last leg of the previous government’s tenure in India, trade in defence was almost stalled due to two reasons: budgetary concerns and the impending elections. The new government still shares some budgetary concerns with the previous government but the intent has been clearer. Clearing pending defence projects in India worth about US$14 billion is a big step to move forward in defence trade with other countries.

Importantly, India has been rational in its defence cooperation with the US and has not succumbed to lobbying, a key instrument in defence deals. Showing the same budgetary concerns, India has told the US that in view of the price increase, it cannot go ahead with the procurement of 145 ultra-light howitzers for the Army, which it planned to deploy in mountainous terrain. Although the US was keen on two military sales to India - the Raytheon/Lockheed Martin-designed Javelin anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) system and the supply of more Apache attack helicopters to the IAF - its primary focus will be on jointly developing and producing military hardware; a theme spelt out by US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, particularly after India declined the Javelin missile offer from the US and chose Spike missiles from Israel.

In the wake of the resolution by the new government that revised an increase in FDI in the Indian defence sector up to 49 per cent, more US companies would be interested to enter the Indian defence sector. These companies are likely to have two very significant expectations from the new government in India: a revised and clear offset policy in the defence sector and a single window clearance system in defence systems’ sale to India. An increase by 10 per cent in the defence budgetary allocation by the new government also carries the potential to take the bilateral relationship forward. The Pentagon showed enthusiasm on the event of Modi’s visit to the US with US Pacific Command head Admiral Samuel Locklear admitting vis-a-vis India-US relations that, ""One of the central focuses early on has been the defence trade initiatives, which will allow us to cooperate with each other on defence articles that would work for both of our security interests.""

Security & Counter-terrorism

Ever since 9/11 both India and the US have embarked on security cooperation like never before. The cooperation that began with the “war against terror” has only grown, particularly with new and divergent modes of threat facing both the countries. In fact security cooperation has been one of the hallmarks of bilateral cooperation. Although the UPA government seized the opportunities to cooperate with the US the last decade, much more needs to be done. The government in India should take the opportunities provided by a willing US and explore likely new areas of cooperation the field of security.

The US has recently hinted that it would provide an exhortative ground for new cooperation with India in the area of security. It recently described cooperation in security as, ""a central element of the broad US-India strategic partnership"" and pledged that it looked forward to work with the new government in New Delhi. The consecutive meetings of John Kerry and Chuck Hagel with India’s National Security Adviser points to important aspects of homeland security as a common agenda for both governments.

Strategic Cooperation

With regard to the strategic partnership with the US, it is important to note that the strategic dimensions of the bilateral relationship has moved from its politico-strategic attributes to taking on economic-strategic ramifications. This transition is likely to have a challenging manifestation for the new government in India. It will be more of a challenge to India than to the US because in the effort to stick to the tenets of ‘strategic autonomy’ and non-alignment, India tends to separate the strategic from the economic, particularly in relation to China.

As the direct objectives of the US against China with India as a bargaining chip have been undercut by the strategic limitations of India’s own foreign policy vis-à-vis China - the compulsions of its ‘strategic autonomy’ - the US has subtly infused the strategic with economic agendas in Asia.

The new government’s astuteness will lie in how forthcoming it will be in taking this mutually beneficial agenda forward. Economic agendas will have to be seen as part of strategic ones and vice versa. The only fear is that the new government in India risks a possible decoupling of the strategic objectives with the economic objectives in its cooperation with the US, in its desire not to appear strategically offensive China. In this regard the new government in India could focus on two specific economic-strategic imperatives propounded by the Obama administration: the New Silk Route and the Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor. The Obama administration has ""placed a strategic bet on regional economic connectivity through its New Silk Road and Indo-Pacific economic corridor initiatives.""

Although India has categorically stated that its strategic deterrence is not directed against any particular country, this should not govern its maritime policy. India has been rankled of late by the increasing Chinese presence in the Asia-Pacific and the Indian Ocean. It is after long that India has shown signs of building its own strategic deterrence against threats from maritime aggression. The development of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands Command (ANC) as a strategic outpost is part of this strategy. It is also in this area that the next government could focus on in cooperating with the US. There has not been much strategic cooperation between the US and India in the maritime domain. Although India’s foreign policy compulsions have not focused exclusively on strategic cooperation with the US, it could be a new area to explore for the new government.

Maritime cooperation, frequent visits and exercises between India’s ANC, and the US presence in Diego Garcia, Guam and possibly the US Pacific Command could provide the required leverage that India needs for erecting a credible maritime deterrence. This will help in honing the security and disaster management skills of the Indian Navy. However, it will not be without the risk of being co-opted in unintended and undesired international conflicts on behalf of the US.

The New Silk Road

The US through its ‘Silk Road Strategy Act of 1999’ floated the concept of the ‘New Silk Route’ that intended to make Afghanistan a transcontinental trade and transit hub by linking it with the West and the Far East. The Obama administration has put special emphasis on this geopolitical concept vis-à-vis its relationship with India. The US understands that India is going to be a constant presence in Afghanistan even after the US withdrawal in 2014. The strong presence of India in Afghanistan together with its domestic support can prove to be a lynchpin for the US to realise its ‘New Silk Route’ dream.

India for its part has also shown strong interest in maintaining its presence to support developmental work in Afghanistan. If the Indian presence in Afghanistan provides stability, the US could very well be successful in building a safe, secure and operational transcontinental ‘New Silk Route’ that crosses Afghanistan.

Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor

Protection of Sea Lines of Communication (SLOC) has been treated as a priority area of cooperation, especially due to the rise of sea piracy and international terrorism. While the Bush administration started the initiative of maritime cooperation between the two countries, the Obama-UPA period failed to capitalise on it adequately. Despite the last government in New Delhi facing the heat from rising maritime concerns in its neighbourhood, little was done to offset them. It could thus be a priority for the Modi government in India to counter-balance these maritime concerns. This can best be done by a two-pronged approach: economic and strategic. In the economic dimension, the nascent concept of the Indo-Pacific should find greater acceptance in that the Indian government should match global expectations by taking a lead role. Greater trade engagement with the countries of the region along with a vanguard security role for the protection of trade through it should form the economic priority.

During a recent Congressional hearing, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel said, ""India is the world's largest democracy; and given its strategic place in Indo-Pacific geography, has an important role to play, an important contribution to make."" The significance of the geopolitical edge that is associated with the Indo-Pacific region is likely to be recognised by the new government in India at a higher scale. Its acknowledgement could include an increased participation of India in both maritime security and trade within this area.

Many US and Indian interests converge when it comes to the Indo-Pacific corridor. Both have enormous trade passing through this area and both are keen on seeing a rule-based maritime order and safe sea lanes for trade. For this, an increased participation of the Indian Navy is required. The Indian Navy could work with the US Pacific Command fleet in maritime patrol, search, rescue and surveillance on the Indo-Pacific corridor. The reconnaissance aircraft P-8I Poseidon that India has imported from the US could be used for the same and the US bases in Guam and Diego Garcia could provide support facilities in such joint operations.

Both India and the US can focus on the security and safe passage of maritime trade that passes through this area, and the US has shown interest that India takes lead in this. The ball is in the present government’s court and it will be in India’s long-term strategic interest to respond in a manner that projects a more responsible role for India, especially in protecting SLOCs. The US has been pressing for a ‘code of conduct’ in the South China Sea against the Chinese push for their version of laws. Drawing from the South China Sea experience and the problems that have arisen between China and its neighbours, India along with the US could push for a universal ‘code of conduct’ for the Indo-Pacific area and the larger Pacific Ocean. The previous government in India embarked on this idea but it remained restricted to the first few steps and could not really take off in the intended sense.

The UPA government in India opened up a credit line worth US$1 million to Vietnam to buy four patrol boats that is likely to guard the Indo-Pacific corridor. The last government also initiated the US-2 Amphibious aircraft deal with Japan. Both these deals are intended for the Indo-Pacific economic corridor but have not been fully accomplished. A uniform international law in this area would serve the Indian and the US governments well to implement a coherent maritime security paradigm.

Corroborating the expectations of Indo-US cooperation in the strategic area of the Indo-Pacific, Admiral Jonathan Greenert said that the US would like to see this cooperation extend to India's participation in exercises in the Western Pacific region, where China is becoming more assertive. This expectation stems from US’ understanding that the new full majority government in India with a leader like Modi at the helm will ensure that the security agencies are well-controlled and monitored. Greater control over national security would mean the likelihood of new forays by its security agencies backed by an outreaching government.

India-US-Japan Trilateral

India’s cooperation with the US under the new government also requires India’s relationship with the former to operates on multilateral levels. The revival and subsequent emphasis on India-US-Japan trilateral relations should be India’s priority. The Modi government in announcing the dates for the trilateral India-US-Japan (June 23-24) within a month of taking over showed the right intent. The invitation to Japan to participate in further editions of the Malabar Exercise could also prove to be a welcome move, if taken up. While the last government only hinted at this, the present government can actually take it forward. The confidence about such a decision must pivot itself on improved Indo-Japanese ties under the new government. In time, the revival of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QSD) by the government in New Delhi could prove effective in extending regional concerns to Australia as a priority, if it plans to build considerable leverage in the Indo-Pacific. Australia’s withdrawal from the QSD and India’s growing distance from Canberra should be seen as juxtaposed with China’s growing proximity with Australia. It will serve Indian strategic interests to get Australia back in the QSD.

Building on Past Trends

Some of the policies vis-à-vis the US under the government in New Delhi are likely to be in continuation of earlier policies. The government will try and build on the gains made by the previous government in these areas.

Some conventional and established areas of cooperation are likely to remain functional. Energy and climate change will remain important areas of cooperation and contestation. Towards clean energy, the two countries could look to consolidate in the areas of using clean energy in telecom towers. Both are also working towards a solar energy alternative to power telecom towers with clean energy. In the field of energy, opportunities could lie in taking forward the initiatives worked out during the tenure of the last government. In particular, Indo-US cooperation will focus on areas like the US-India Energy Dialogue, US-India Climate Change Dialogue and the US-India Civil Nuclear Energy. Apart from these, two groups would likely remain in focus under the current government: Oil and Gas Working Group and the New Joint Working Group on Sustainable Growth.

India should ideally be the recipient of LNG from the US, which finds its roots in an understanding between the US DoE (Department of Energy) and India’s energy major GAIL under the last government in India. In this regard, the shale gas feasibility study is an area of cooperation that the India could take seriously. The US made an exception for India when the DoE in May 2013 announced that it had conditionally authorised Freeport LNG Expansion, LP and FLNG Liquefaction, LLC (Freeport) to export domestically-produced LNG to non-FTA countries from the Freeport Terminal on Quintana Island in Texas. This was very significant from India’s point of view as the existing federal law requires approval of natural gas exports to countries that have an FTA with the US, which India does not have. The Modi government is faced with an opportunity to explore this option if it has to satiate its energy demands.

Apart from numerous MoUs, the fundamental focus of the new government could be to ease the process of educational exchanges that take place between the two countries by creating more scope for strategic institutional partnerships and facilitating more faculty and student exchanges. In this regard, the Singh-Obama Knowledge Initiative of 2009 is likely to remain the primary focus.

Challenges Ahead

Despite the convergences, there are prominent challenges that might prove to be potential obstacles that could derail the bilateral relations between India and the US. Protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), which remains a concern with US pharma companies, has the potential to become a headache. India could welcome the request of top American executives to initiate a dialogue in this regard. Other concerns for could include some of the recent bilateral trade disputes. The 2012 disputes over steel duties imposed by the US on India and the poultry ban by India on the US, apart from prohibitions on some other US import items, should serve as precedents for the new government to address issues of potential confrontation in trade.

Another major concern for India is likely to be the implementation of a stricter visa regime in August 2012 by the US. This is slated to directly impact Indian IT firms. Prior to this, the US had already cut the number of visas granted to workers from India. Even as the US is on the verge of overhauling its immigration policy, the challenge for the new government in New Delhi will be to protect Indian interests that are hinged on an expanded and inclusive US immigration policy.

Conclusion

No sooner had the new government assumed office in New Delhi, there was a visible US effort to better relations as well as mend its past equations with the Prime Minister of India. This ranged from the possibility of appointing a Gujarati as an interim chargé d'affaires at the US Embassy in New Delhi to rushing several diplomats to India. These moves were necessary to balm the bruise that was caused by the diplomatic row of 2013. Yet, the US has taken considerably long in appointing a permanent ambassador to India.

For now, the Modi government, by its clear majority and a foreign policy focus on the immediate neighbourhood (also read as a snubbing of the US), has put the ball back in the US’ court. The US has been galvanised into action, reflected in its rushing Nisha Desai Biswal, the Obama administration's point person for South and Central Asia, to New Delhi to hold talks with Indian officials on a series of bilateral and regional issues. Kerry and Chuck Hagel are believed to have done substantial groundwork to prepare for the much anticipated meeting between Narendra Modi and Barack Obama.

The Indian government led by PM Modi has shown a very pragmatic and result-oriented approach to its relationship with the US. Any sign of succumbing or yielding to pressure from the US has been smartly ducked by India. Modi’s visit to the US, following the UNGA address, was fitting to the extent that after addressing a gathering of world leaders, he moved on to arguably the world’s most important country, the US. The warm reception extended by the Obama Administration and the ‘rockstar’ reception by the Indian American community in the US left no doubt that the visit was successful. More importantly, with the Republicans winning in the recent domestic elections in the US, the chances of them coming to power in the national elections in 2016 has increased. If that were to happen, the Modi administration in India will be looking forward to the change.

Modi visited the US at the invitation of President Joe Biden and met him on all three days of his stay here between June 21 and June 23.On June 22, the two leaders spent time together for more than eight hours, the official said. Biden also held a private dinner for Modi on June 21.India and the United States have never had a stronger relationship than right now, the official said post-Modi visit, it has never been deeper in the memory of the president.The official said China was a major issue of discussion between the two leaders.""In reality... it (China) is not the glue of our relationship at all, but it's one of the factors and I think we're gonna have that glue for a long time to come,"" the official, familiar with the discussions between the two leaders last month, said on condition of anonymity.Both India and the United States believe that China poses a major national security threat to them, the official said, noting that the Biden administration thinks New Delhi has been ahead of Washington in terms of handling Beijing.The Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights Uzra Zeya had a meeting with the Dalai Lama a couple of weeks ago in New Delhi, and ""the Chinese kind of went nuts about that"", the official noted.""They (Indians are) in some ways were ahead of us. It is much more existential for them in terms of countering the China threat. Whether it's banning TikTok, whether it was building up mobile networks with no Chinese equipment, they've actually shown a way forward of what de-risking looks like. And that's why I think they're so critical,"" said the official.""At the same time, they still depend on a lot of Chinese things, just like we do. China has been a real irritant in the G-20 for them...,"" the official noted, giving an insight into the G-20 discussions and the balancing act that India is doing to bring all stakeholders together.In India ""Modi's popularity is about 80 per cent in some polls, so is America's,"" the senior administration said.""That's not just reflected at the very top which is where we usually write about or hear about. It's, I think, underneath that at the government-to-government level business-to-business level. And then people to people,"" the official said.""Vice Versa, if the bridge from India to America is a steel reinforced four-lane highway, a strong, stable bridge; I would describe in years past the bridge from America to India has been like a rope bridge with every other plank missing. Like we don't know India and Indians anywhere near the level that India and Indians know America and Americans. I think that's beginning to change,"" said the official, referring to a large number of high-level visits to India.There's hardly a week or two that goes by without a major US government representative being in the country. And then on the business side, it's like a steady stream of CEOs, he said, adding ""some have better strategies than others, but everybody's like rushing India.""""It's one of those moments where, if you rewind the clock, China 15 years ago was raising people at this pace out of poverty into the middle class. India is actually doing it a little faster than China was 15 or 20 years ago. You just look at the metrics, whether it's the number one source of student visas now, India surpassed China last year, whether it's the investment, which is a record level, and we're the number one trading partner for India for the first time. And another number of other metrics,"" the official said.""This is the most significant country in many ways for them and becoming one of the most. The president said one of the most consequential relationships we have. Privately he's expressed ... that this is the most important relationship that we have, at least in terms of growth and, and the future,"" said the official."

They also welcomed the commencement of construction of a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in India. The leaders called on their administrations to extend these partnerships to advanced biotechnology and biomanufacturing, and enhance biosafety and biosecurity innovation, practices, and norms.



Powering a Next Generation Defense Partnership



11. The India-U.S Major Defense Partnership has emerged as a pillar of global peace and security. Through joint exercises, strengthening of defense industrial cooperation, the annual ""2+2” Ministerial Dialogue, and other consultative mechanisms, we have made substantial progress in building an advanced and comprehensive defense partnership in which our militaries coordinate closely across all domains. The leaders appreciated the strong military-to-military ties, mutual logistics support, and efforts to streamline implementation of foundational agreements. They noted that information sharing and placement of Liaison Officers in each other’s military organizations will spur joint service cooperation.

TRANSCRIPT

[music]

DOLLAR: Hi, I’m David Dollar, host of the Brookings trade podcast Dollar and Sense. Today we’re going to talk about India and Prime Minister Modi’s state visit to the United States. My guest is Tanvi Madan, senior fellow and director of the India Project at Brookings. So, welcome to the show, Tanvi.

MADAN: Thanks, David. It’s good to be on the podcast.

DOLLAR: So, let’s start with the state visit for Prime Minister Modi. What does this mean for him? What is he trying to achieve in this visit?

MADAN: I think there are few different objectives for Prime Minister Modi. For one, it is really to both a reflection of the state of the U.S.-India relationship, which is really burdened under Prime Minister Modi. It’s not that he’s a major departure from his predecessors for the last 20 years, 20 or 25 years, you’ve seen Indian governments deepen ties with the U.S. across the board. But you have seen an uptick across pretty much every domain during the course of the Modi government, which came into power in 2014. And so, I think in some part it’s a reflection for him, and of the Biden administration, to kind of recognize the role he himself has played in deepening these ties.

For Prime Minister Modi, this is an opportunity to really consolidate ties with the country that he has previously in the U.S. called indispensable to India’s transformation. A former Indian national security advisor in the previous government, our former colleague at Brookings, who was at Brookings India, Shivshankar Menon, had said that the U.S. is the one country that is really critical for pretty much every aspect of Indian growth, for security, for technology. And Prime Minister Modi’s policies have reflected that. So, it’s a really kind of a consolidation of those ties. It’s served, this visit is serving as a bit of an action forcing event to get some major deals through. We’ve already heard some news on that.

And then finally, for Prime Minister Modi, it’s also in some ways a political message. There’ll be some political messaging involved. Part of the case he has made to the Indian public is that he is promised to make India respected on the world stage. Now, some will say that India was respected on the world stage before, but an Indian audience has bought this idea and there is this sense, and you hear this from commentators who go to India, come back to talk about the optimism there. And part of it is the story of a kind of being, as they put it, aspiring to be a leading power on the world stage. And so, I think this visit will be seen in that context.

And there’s an election due in 2024, and Prime Minister Modi, I think, will also kind of highlight this visit perhaps in his election campaign.

DOLLAR: That’s an interesting theme that we can carry through to other parts of the interview, that the United States can be useful to India in meeting various objectives. And one of those important objectives is raising the technological level of the economy and of the whole society. And I see that as the U.S. and India have deepened their relations, they’ve announced a strategic partnership on critical and emerging technologies. So, that sounds great. But what substance is there? What does that really mean?

MADAN: They’ve even come up with an acronym, ICET. So, you know when there’s an acronym, it’s probably going to stick around a bit. What this is, is it’s not one kind of big deal, one major deal in its own right. What it is, it’s a framework, it’s a mechanism, it’s really a mechanism to build a strategic trade and technology partnership between the two countries. Not that one didn’t exist, but there was this sense that, you know, there are a lot of these issues that cross the defense, technology, economic domains, innovation domains, and these were interagency by nature, and that you really did need kind of a vehicle to both focus on and try to push some of these things through.

So, what you’ve seen is this was something that was discussed last year by the prime minister and President Biden. And earlier this year, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval launched this. And national Security Advisor Sullivan was just in India for the next stage of this. And the idea behind this is really to focus on a few different domains: is to deepen cooperation in the defense industrial space and the innovation space as well; to try to work on semiconductor supply chains as both countries try to diversify. There’s also a different kind of dialogs and movement in space on the commercial side. Innovation across the board, particularly nurturing talent and developing an innovation bridge between the two countries, developing more secure telecommunications network, as well alternatives.

Now, some of this is being done bilaterally. Some of this is also coming under coming under the Quad, which is the Australia-India-Japan-U.S. grouping, which has its own critical and emerging technologies dialogues. But really what this is, is to try to get some of these initiatives to move forward. So, they’re just taking these, say like the defense industrial cooperation side, drilling down on one or two deals and actually trying to push them through. So, the one that they’re focused on right now is for GE to potentially produce its 414 jet engine in India, co-produce it there, for the indigenously-developed Indian fighter aircraft, so, combat aircraft. So, that’s the kind of thing that they’re trying to trying to develop.

And the people like buzz words. And so I think the buzzwords around these are things like “security and resilience,” “technology and talent.” And so you’ve seen this is really a almost kind of, you know, like people say an action forcing an event. This is kind of an initiative that is a forcing initiative. What is interesting about it is this is perhaps the first dialogue I can think of that is led by the National Security Councils in both countries. There are other dialogs that have come out of it, including a very new, just met a couple of weeks ago, the strategic trade dialogue, which is basically to drill down and identify obstacles and overcome them in terms of export controls and those kind of issues.

So, you’re seeing a lot of things coming out of it. But I think this is one of these initiatives where we won’t know for another ten years if it was really successful or not. We’ll see some announcements when Prime Minister Modi is here coming out of it. But I think the true nature of it, because if it works, it would be a generational investment in the relationship and particularly the innovation side of it.

DOLLAR: For this kind of technological cooperation between India and the United States, it seems to me that having this large Indian diaspora in the U.S. has to be an advantage. So, I assume they’re pretty happy with the way relations are developing between the U.S. and India. Do they have any specific concerns?

MADAN: It is very much at the core, in fact, in some ways of ICET itself. But even on the societal, the people-to-people dimension side, when cabinet officials, cabinet ministers on both sides talk about this relationship, especially on the U.S. side, you’ve heard them bringing up the people-to-people dimension a lot more. There’s now a diaspora of over 4 million, and it’s still quite small compared to other immigrant groups. But nonetheless, particularly … and I was just running the numbers and you’ve seen 76% … there are almost 200,000 Indian students now in the U.S., and 76% of them are in STEM fields. The innovation side of that ICET that really is very much. And so it’s forming this natural bridge that even if people return, or, it’s connecting the two industries.

I think the diaspora is quite supportive of and likes that U.S.-India ties have developed. One trend that we we’ve seen kind of in recent years is not fissures in the diaspora, but you’re really seeing the diversity of the diaspora where our colleagues at Carnegie next door have done a study on Indian Americans and how they vote, and they tend to kind of vote on issues that matter to them, not necessarily on U.S.-India relations. But as a result of that, they largely vote Democratic. But they do have issues that they’re concerned about even within the community. You’re seeing, whether on religious lines, sometimes on even issues like caste, that you are seeing some divergences. In some ways, that’s natural. India’s a very diverse country, and the Indian American diaspora, as it grows, is reflecting that.

Also, some differences between immigrants who are recent immigrants versus those who’ve been there for ages. But you really do see and sometimes a lot of diversity in terms of where in India they come from as well.

DOLLAR: Yeah. So, this essentially migration you’re talking about—many coming as students, but you know, some staying, people settling—I mean, that’s a really important part of globalization. And personally, I’m just very excited to hear the numbers you mentioned. I think it’s a real strength of the United States system that we have this consistent immigration and the sending countries, there’s a lot of research now indicating that there can be benefits in building these ties between different countries. So, all that sounds quite positive.

MADAN: As a beneficiary of it myself, David, having come here for graduate school and done two graduate degrees, I can’t but agree with you. And I think across the board, I hope this is something that is recognized that this the migration and it really does connect societies, economies, and is mutually beneficial.

DOLLAR: And people-to-people. You know, we get all the great Bollywood movies.

MADAN: That’s right. Yeah, that’s right. Bollywood movies. And you’ve got Padma Lakshmi, too. So, if you like cooking, you get that as well.

DOLLAR: So far, the whole conversation has been a bit of a love fest that, U.S. and India are developing their relations, a lot of positive things developing. If I could mention one thorn in the side of the relationship, it’s the Russian invasion of Ukraine and India’s pretty strong relations with Russia. It’s increasing imports of oil from Russia during this time. Is this likely to be an important issue of discussion or are the two sides just going to accept that this is something we disagree a bit on and just move on to the other areas?

MADAN: I think it’s going to be a bit of both. I think the U.S. and India, I don’t know if they’ve agreed to disagree, but they have accepted or at least tolerate the differences that exist. And they’re doing that, you know, managing this and other differences in part because there is strategic convergence, for instance, on the Indo-Pacific. And both have been prioritizing that, that convergence, both in terms of the goals they share there and the concerns they have about China’s behavior in the region.

But on Russia, you’ve seen, I think also that over the last—you know, this could have been, particularly after the Russian invasion and when India was not voting to condemn Russia at the at the U.N.—it abstained—but nonetheless, that did create some amount of friction, as did its imports of oil. But you’ve seen over time both sides also narrow the gap between each other. They’ve discussed this at various levels consistently. Because one thing India does shares, several of its interests have been adversely affected—economic, energy, others, even geopolitical, by the Russian invasion. And while they might not call it that, they do call it the Russia-Ukraine war, but they do recognize the damage it’s done. And potentially to Russia itself, which they do see as a partner. And so, I think you’ve seen the gap narrowed because of consultations, because of the duration of the war and its continuing impacts across the world.

I think the other aspect you’ve seen is to some extent, just as Indian concerns have grown as, for instance, food, fuel, and fertilizer prices, there’s been pressure on that. But also, as Russia is their largest supplier of defense equipment, and they are unable to pay and Russia is unable to deliver some of that. So, concern about that supply chain as well.

But you’ve also seen on the U.S. side some change where earlier they would consider kind of India’s oil imports a problem. And just to give your audience a sense, India, at the beginning of 2021, if you had looked at the 2022, if you looked at the figures, about 2% of India’s oil imports came from Russia. Now it’s kind of over a quarter of not between a quarter and a third. Earlier, you had the U.S. objecting to it, but then the U.S. recognized that, you know, you actually want I think a lot of energy experts say you don’t want to take this oil off the market. And so, just put a price caps to reduce Russia’s revenue and India has largely imported under that price cap. So, I think that issue has become less thorny.

You’ve also seen India take slightly different, not slightly, but they think a significantly different stance than China. Prime Minister Modi just met with President Zelensky. They’ve spoken multiple times and played a role on specific issues like the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as well as on pressing Russia when it was suspending the Black Sea grain initiative.

So, they’ve taken a slightly different stance, which I think is also eased, eased kind of the differences. But I think the reason that they haven’t been more kind of full of friction is because of that larger strategic convergence, which gives both sides an incentive to manage the differences. But this is a difference that will continue to exist. Russia will remain for because India sees it potentially as a balancing power maybe 20 years from now vis-à-vis China; right now they’re worried about Russia-China relations.

But also it remains, if for no other reason, it is still a lot of Indian frontline military equipment is dependent on Russian spares, on Russian servicing, and is still of Russian or Soviet origin. And that is going to be a generational effort for India to both diversify, which it’s been doing now for the last ten years, but also to indigenize. And that’s the other trend we’re seeing.

DOLLAR: You know, I completely agree with you, Tanvi, about the effects on the oil market. Pre-invasion, basically, Russia was sending about 55% of their petroleum to Europe and about 20% went to China, India if you combine them. And now it’s flipped. More than 50% of their oil is going to China and India, and Europe’s share is down to about 20%. But Russia is exporting about the same amount. And I actually think that’s an advantageous situation because we dodged a big oil price shock. It went up at the beginning of the Ukraine war, but now the price of oil is actually below where it was pre-invasion, and that’s even before you start applying any cap. So, I think we have dodged a big oil shock.

And then on the other hand, the sanctions are keeping Russia from importing a lot of stuff. So, I think the sanctions are working very well on the import side. And all of that creates a situation where the U.S. will probably bring this up with Prime Minister Modi, but it’s, as you say, it’s going to be small within the context of the larger strategic relationship.

MADAN: Yeah. And, you know, this time last year, I don’t think Prime Minister Modi would have been invited for a state dinner, partly because of those differences. But I think, for the reasons you’re saying—and I didn’t realize that those numbers were the case—one of the things this is stirring up into Russia-India case is that India now has this large trade deficit with Russia that I think is only second to their trade deficit with China, which is also massive. And this is creating a problem. And the last time senior Indian officials met their Russian counterparts, they said, Look, this is unsustainable, you know, we need to have more balanced trade. This didn’t really used to be a problem in Russia-India relations.

And it is also a problem that this Russia-India trade that has gone up to close to kind of 30 or maybe just crossed $30 billion is quite unnatural, because before that, for the last 10, 20 years, Russia and India have been trying to increase non-defense trade. It’s remained stuck below $10 billion. So, now it’s gone up, but it’s dependent on this very specific commodity. India doesn’t really import that much, if any, I think, gas or very small quantities of LNG from Russia, and some coal. But it’s largely this one commodity. And I’m sure the Russians are thinking about the fact that just as India increased oil imports, it could just as well decrease them over time and go elsewhere if they get a better deal. So, one questions for the Russians is going to be how long are they going to offer these discounts that these countries are demanding?

DOLLAR: Let’s switch gears a little bit and talk about the G-20, because India for the first time is the president, I guess they call it, of the G-20. And so, Prime Minister Modi will be hosting the other G-20 heads of state, I think, in September, if I—

MADAN: —that’s right, yeah—

DOLLAR: —if I remember correctly. Yeah. So, what’s India trying to do with the G-20? What are some of the main issues and agenda items?

MADAN: David, I will say to start this is not the G-20 India had thought it would be because so much attention is around, you know, whether both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and that impact, and for Prime Minister Modi thinking about the Indians will invite President Putin—they are not signatories to the Rome Statute. So, that question will not arise. Now, whether he goes or not is another matter.

Perhaps even more controversial in India is going to be the presence of Xi Jinping, because the last time he was in India was before the two countries had the boundary crisis in 2020, and he was there in November 2019. The two leaders have not really had a bilateral meeting since then, and Modi and Xi had met a record number of times prior to that, I think about 18 times in over six years.

But for the G-20 itself, I think these are going to be the sideline issues, which is who is actually going to make it, this kind of tension between the West and Russia and China. But also, I think on the substantive issue, India has really actually invested a lot over this last year into this process—hosted a number of ministerials, had working groups. And they focused largely, I’d say, you know, the one word I can put it is “development,” inclusive and resilient growth is how they’re thinking about it.

And this has got to many aspects. There’s the more proactive delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals, thinking about green growth is another emphasis. Women’s empowerment and women-led initiatives has been another aspect of development.

But you’ve also seen, I think, India try to use the G-20 to showcase kind of some digital technology solutions, and particularly its digital public infrastructure, what they call the India stack, which they both use the G-20 meetings to showcase to those visiting, but also to try to kind of say, look, this is a more open alternative to—and they never use the word China—to those that our closed systems are offering.

Now in the West, I think people have a different kind of maybe view of some of these some of the spots of infrastructure. But nonetheless, I think what India is doing is more broadly bringing focus to the idea of digital public infrastructure as something that can really facilitate inclusivity and development as well. And that’s been the kind of more proactive side.

I think the reactive side on the development has been really to discuss and deal with the fallout of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, of COVID as well, and countries kind of still suffering from that. And that’s been both in terms of thinking about food, fuel, fertilizer, security, but also in terms of the debt crisis that in some cases is looming, in some cases we’ve already seen in India’s neighborhood, both in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, real kind of economic setbacks, because of the kind of debt crises that both have.

So, I think there’s been both this proactive and reactive element to India’s G-20. And then another issue, which is kind of across the board, both in terms of global economic governance as well as across other institutions, and India’s talking about as it looks at G-20 as a multilateral institution, the need to reform actual multilateral institutions, and not just for itself, but saying developing countries need a bigger role. It already has and it likely will ahead of the G-20 summit host something like a Voice of Global South Summit to say, look, that is an important aspect. Can’t just be these 20 countries.

So, the way that the Modi government has portrayed it as, you know, we are a bridge between the North and the South, the East and the West, and I think they will try to reflect that.

And then finally, I think for an Indian objective, or rather the Modi government’s objective with the G-20 is going back to that aspect that I mentioned in terms of the state visit, which is political, that again, this fits into Prime Minister Modi’s showcasing India as on the high table, so to speak, and that, you know, he will say he’s played a role. Some of his critics say, well, you know, it’s the G-20, it rotates. So, it’s not that it’s being held because you’re prime minister. But nonetheless, he is showcasing it. And he’s made it a point to host these meetings around the country, so not just in New Delhi. It’s probably nicer for visitors as well that they get to go to Goa and the Andamans and not just a conference room in Delhi. But, this really has been part of has been for him a political instrument as well.

DOLLAR: Last topic, Tanvi, is let’s just talk a little bit more about India’s trade and investment policies. One of the fun things I got to do in the World Bank was visit quite a few factories in India. This would have been 20 years ago, basically, more than 20 years ago. And I remember visiting some auto plants, actually making auto parts, and everything was a joint venture. I’m not going to name companies, but a joint venture between an Indian company and a big international, well-named company. And these were 50-50 joint ventures. There was a lot of tensions and problems and low productivity, frankly. As I see it, India has really opened up quite a few sectors, including automotive, to 100% foreign investment. So, I haven’t had a chance to visit factories recently, but from the data it seems like India is really becoming more open. Is that real and is that likely to continue? And how do Indian people feel about this?

MADAN: It’s quite interesting. What you have seen is a Modi government that initially when they came in was one that in fact moved backwards in terms of … it did open up. In the investment side that was true. They opened up a number of sectors, including to 100% FDI. But on the trade side, they were a little bit more protectionist. They basically said, We don’t want to do bilateral investment treaties, we don’t want to do free trade agreements. The ones that India had done were considered to have not been free and fair. And so, they really had the attitude that these agreements weren’t good. They increased import duties on several inputs, industrial inputs. And so, they were seen as more protectionist than previous governments and perhaps the most protectionist in the trade space at least since India started liberalizing in the 1990s.

Now, there were other reforms that they did undertake that also did help in terms of the business environment, including in the banking sector, including in terms of now building infrastructure across the board. And so, that’s helped.

But what you’ve also seen simultaneously is a Modi government shift in recent years on trade. It’s not suddenly a free trader on the whole, but it has become more open to bilateral trade agreements with what they call “trusted partners.” And so you’ve seen India sign a trade agreement, an initial trade agreement, with Australia, with the UAE. They’re being negotiated with the UK, with Canada, the EU-India trade negotiations have been revived as well. Currently the U.S., we’re not interested in trade deals, otherwise I’m sure they would have wanted to talk about that. They did join at least three of the four pillars of IPEF, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. And so, you’re starting to see them rethink this aspect.

Now, one of the reasons they’re doing this is because just as they are trying to kind of reduce their exposure to China in particular—China’s their second largest trading partner, but also is the main source of the Indian deficit; and also because of their border crisis, there’s just a more intense competition, India’s concerned about its vulnerability in the economic space and this overdependence—and so, as they tried to reduce their own exposure, they’ve been trying to diversify their suppliers. And so, that’s helped them rethink trade.

But at the same time, they’re also trying to take advantage of other countries trying to diversify. And so, in this space, both on the manufacturing and trade side, you’ve seen, for example, an Apple start to say that we want to produce in India, move some amount of production and some to Vietnam as well. But you’ve also seen India then having to adjust where one of the things that a company like that says is, Look, we’re not going to move our entire supply chain there. We still need to be able to import from China. And so, India’s adjust to that and is making exceptions.

So, you have seen the government rethink this. They’ve got something called a production-linked incentive scheme in particular sectors where they are trying to diversify like electronics, like pharmaceuticals, like solar power. And so, they have been more open in that sense.

There is also the sense, and they’re quite open about it, where there is this emphasis on what they call atmanirbhar Bharat—self-reliance. And I think where the tug is just domestically in the debate is what does the self-reliance mean? Does it mean self-sufficiency on one end of the spectrum, or does it mean resilience in the sense of having some amount of domestic production, but also diversifying kind of a mixture of friend-shoring and reshoring or on-shoring? And I think this debate continues in India. Where do you … there is a sense from some foreign companies that India does put its thumb on its scale for domestic companies. India argues that all countries do that. But I think you’ve seen really this push and pull. You see it constantly in the Indian government’s approach. And sometimes you could see that they do move on these issues.

But really to me this is the fundamental debate, not just in the economic arena but across the board, is this debate over how open to be to the world. In the geopolitical space, how open to be to partners, how close to get to partners; and in the economic space and technology space how much to really work with others, like-minded countries. And you have some like the external affairs ministers who’ve said, Look, we have to make choices because globalization and technology aren’t economic issues, they’re strategic issues. So, we have to be open, but we have to be open to just more trusted partners, or as they call them, trusted geographies. So, I think, that’s where you’re probably seeing India come down.

DOLLAR: I’m David Dollar and I’ve been talking to my colleague Tanvi Madan about India, fifth biggest economy in the world, fastest growing big economy. So, probably going to move up to number three before too long and punching pretty strongly in the world economy both economically and politically. So, thank you for all those insights, Tanvi, as we await Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the United States.

MADAN: Thanks so much, David.

Modi’s speech on Capitol Hill got standing ovations and was applauded numerous times. The visit had the world glued for clues of how a deepening US-India engagement will influence a global order being reshaped in a century that may soon have more Asian characteristics than American. Biden has framed today’s global challenge as one of democracy versus autocracy. In ignoring, at least publicly, 75 fellow Democrats who called on him to raise India’s human rights record with Modi, the US leader made it clear that Washington had a long-term prism for a “strategic partnership"" which is set for an upshift that could tilt outcomes in our mutual interest. Away, that is, from China’s, whose autocracy got a pointed mention from Biden on the eve of Modi’s visit and explains why ‘democracy’ was its theme music.

Both leaders being up for re-election in 2024 gave it the stamp of a favourable political calculus, too. Even former President Barack Obama’s reference in a TV interview to minority rights in India was packaged as friendly advice on national unity. For an emergent India to act as what US strategists call a “swing state"" in the Indo-Pacific, friction had to be kept minimal and the regional balance of arms adjusted accordingly. Notably, while China is a common threat, New Delhi’s ties with Russia did not get in the way. Indian purchases of Russian oil mitigated the Ukraine war’s economic impact, after all, while our defiant deal with Moscow for S-400 anti-missile firepower in the face of US sanctions may have upped the ante in a global market for weaponry where India is the biggest buyer. Even as hostilities in Europe revived America’s Cold Warrior frame of reference, a “no limits"" clasp between Russia and China lent urgency to securing the Indo-Pacific, where tension has mounted over Beijing’s designs on Taiwan. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s stout resistance to Russia—now facing a mercenary crisis—could be decoded as a wonder of US backing in an age of warfare aided by live data. It is no big wonder India and America are now in a close embrace. That hesitations belong to history has been obvious for quite a while.

Commerce is entwined in the relationship not just for its own gains, but also for a mutually consonant geo-strategic agenda to be served. India’s economic rise would be in America’s interest just as much as US leadership of technology enablers and global affairs would be in ours. For the partnership to endure and gain, this reality must not be lost in noise over India’s neutrality on the world stage and refusal to be bound by a Nato-like bloc—best taken as a signal of sovereignty. Durable ties draw strength from principles, as both countries have underlined. Yet, while early stirrings of Cold War II may be upon us, globally, US support for free trade and open markets has wobbled in a way that does not bode well, going by what unfolded in the first half of the previous century. Sure, India would welcome a smoother path for exports to the US, with bilateral trade disputes speedily resolved, not to speak of business gains from fraught Sino-US ties. All the same, both must eschew zero-sum formulations that leave the world worse off or endanger peace."
264,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/22/joint-statement-from-the-united-states-and-india/,Joint Statement from the United States and India,2023-06-22 00:00:00,"1. President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Prime Minister Narendra Modi today affirmed a vision of the United States and India as among the closest partners in the world – a partnership of democracies looking into the 21st century with hope, ambition, and confidence. The U.S.-India Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership is anchored in a new level of trust and mutual understanding and enriched by the warm bonds of family and friendship that inextricably link our countries together. Together, we will build an even stronger, diverse U.S.-India partnership that will advance the aspirations of our people for a bright and prosperous future grounded in respect for human rights, and shared principles of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. Our cooperation will serve the global good as we work through a range of multilateral and regional groupings – particularly the Quad– to contribute toward a free, open, inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific. No corner of human enterprise is untouched by the partnership between our two great countries, which spans the seas to the stars.

Rao Satellite Centre in Bengaluru, India, and looked forward to NISAR’s 2024 launch from India. Welcoming India’s Space Policy – 2023, the leaders called for enhanced commercial collaboration between the U.S. and Indian private sectors in the entire value chain of the space economy and to address export controls and facilitate technology transfer. President Biden deeply appreciated India’s signing of the Artemis Accords, which advance a common vision of space exploration for the benefit of all humankind.



4. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi committed their administrations to promoting policies and adapting regulations that facilitate greater technology sharing, co-development, and co-production opportunities between U.S. and Indian industry, government, and academic institutions. The leaders welcomed the launch of the interagency-led Strategic Trade Dialogue in June2023 and directed both sides to undertake regular efforts to address export controls, explore ways of enhancing high technology commerce, and facilitate technology transfer between the two countries.



5. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi hailed the signing of an MoU on Semiconductor Supply Chain and Innovation Partnership as a significant step in the coordination of our countries’ semiconductor incentive programs. This will promote commercial opportunities, research, talent, and skill development. The leaders welcomed an announcement by Micron Technology, Inc., to invest up to $825 million to build a new semiconductor assembly and test facility in India with support from the Indian government. The combined investment valued at $2.75 billion would create up to 5,000 new direct and 15,000 community jobs opportunities in the next five years. The leaders also welcomed Lam Research’s proposal to train 60,000 Indian engineers through its Semiverse Solution virtual fabrication platform to accelerate India’s semiconductor education and workforce development goals, and an announcement by Applied Materials, Inc., to invest $400 million to establish a collaborative engineering center in India.



6. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi share a vision of creating secure and trusted telecommunications, resilient supply chains, and enabling global digital inclusion. To fulfill this vision, the leaders launched two Joint Task Forces on advanced telecommunications, focused on Open RAN and research and development in 5G/6G technologies. Public-private cooperation between vendors and operators will be led by India’s Bharat 6G Alliance and the U.S. Next G Alliance. We are partnering on Open RAN field trials and rollouts, including scaled deployments, in both countries with operators and vendors of both markets, backed by U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) financing. The leaders welcomed participation of Indian companies in the U.S. Rip and Replace Program. They endorsed an ambitious vision for 6G networks, including standards cooperation, facilitating access to chipsets for system development, and establishing joint research and development projects. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi also stressed the need to put in place a “Trusted Network/Trusted Sources” bilateral framework.



7. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi welcomed the establishment of a joint Indo-U.S. Quantum Coordination Mechanism to facilitate collaboration among industry, academia, and government, and our work toward a comprehensive Quantum Information Science and Technology agreement. The United States welcomes India’s participation in the Quantum Entanglement Exchange and in the Quantum Economic Development Consortium to facilitate expert and commercial exchanges with leading, like-minded quantum nations. The United States and India will sustain and grow quantum training and exchange programs and work to reduce barriers to U.S.-India research collaboration. The leaders welcomed the launch of a $2million grant program under the U.S.-India Science and Technology Endowment fund for the joint development and commercialization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum technologies, and encouraged public-private collaborations to develop high performance computing (HPC) facilities in India. President Biden also reiterated his government’s commitment to work with U.S. Congress to lower barriers to U.S. exports to India of HPC technology and source code. The U.S. side pledged to make its best efforts in support of India’s Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) joining the U.S. Accelerated Data Analytics and Computing (ADAC) Institute.



8. The leaders welcomed 35 innovative joint research collaborations in emerging technologies funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Indian Department of Science and Technology (DST). Under a new implementation arrangement between NSF and DST, both sides will fund joint research projects in computer and information science and engineering, cyber physical systems, and secure and trustworthy cyberspace. Furthermore, NSF and India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology will bring fresh funding for joint projects in applied research areas such as semiconductors, next generation communication, cyber security, sustainability and green technologies and intelligent transportation systems.



9. Both President Biden and Prime Minister Modi acknowledge the profound opportunities and significant risks associated with AI. Accordingly, they committed to develop joint and international collaboration on trustworthy and responsible AI, including generative AI, to advance AI education and workforce initiatives, promote commercial opportunities, and mitigate against discrimination and bias. The United States also supports India’s leadership as Chair of the Global Partnership on AI. The leaders applauded Google’s intent to continue investing through its $10 billion India Digitization Fund, including in early-stage Indian startups. Through its AI Research Center in India, Google is building models to support over 100 Indian languages.



10. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi hailed our deepening bilateral cooperation on cutting-edge scientific infrastructure, including a $140 million in-kind contribution from the Indian Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Fermi National Laboratory toward collaborative development of the Proton Improvement Plan-II Accelerator, for the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility — the first and largest international research facility on U.S. soil. They also welcomed the commencement of construction of a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in India. The leaders called on their administrations to extend these partnerships to advanced biotechnology and biomanufacturing, and enhance biosafety and biosecurity innovation, practices, and norms.



Powering a Next Generation Defense Partnership



11. The U.S.-India Major Defense Partnership has emerged as a pillar of global peace and security. Through joint exercises, strengthening of defense industrial cooperation, the annual “2+2” Ministerial Dialogue, and other consultative mechanisms, we have made substantial progress in building an advanced and comprehensive defense partnership in which our militaries coordinate closely across all domains. The leaders appreciated the strong military-to-military ties, mutual logistics support, and efforts to streamline implementation of foundational agreements. They noted that information sharing and placement of Liaison Officers in each other’s military organizations will spur joint service cooperation. They also reiterated their resolve to strengthen maritime security cooperation, including through enhanced underwater domain awareness. The leaders welcomed the launch of dialogues in new defense domains including space and AI, which will enhance capacity building, knowledge, and expertise.



12. Expressing their desire to accelerate defense industrial cooperation, the leaders welcomed the adoption of a Defense Industrial Cooperation Roadmap, which will provide policy direction to defense industries and enable co-production of advanced defense systems and collaborative research, testing, and prototyping of projects. Both sides are committed to addressing any regulatory barriers to defense industrial cooperation. The leaders also noted the decision of India’s Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense to commence negotiations for concluding a Security of Supply arrangement and initiate discussions about Reciprocal Defense Procurement agreement.



13. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi hailed the landmark signing of an MoU between General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for the manufacture of GE F-414 jet engines in India, for the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited Light Combat Aircraft Mk 2. This trailblazing initiative to manufacture F-414 engines in India will enable greater transfer of U.S. jet engine technology than ever before. The leaders committed their governments to working collaboratively and expeditiously to support the advancement of this unprecedented co-production and technology transfer proposal.



14. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi also welcomed India’s emergence as a hub for maintenance and repair for forward deployed U.S. Navy assets and the conclusion of Master Ship Repair Agreements with Indian shipyards.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's U. S. visit will boost bilateral ties and deepen strategic technology collaboration in areas like defence, semiconductor, space and artificial intelligence, India Inc. said on June 24.

PM Modi left for Egypt on Saturday after concluding his U.S. state visit, during which he held talks with President Joe Biden and addressed the joint session of Congress.

CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee stated that the visit has culminated in laying a strong foundation for further strengthening the Indo-US relationship.

“A new chapter has been added to the partnership that will see a much stronger collaboration in strategic technology collaboration, including defence, semiconductor, and space and in emerging technology sectors like AI and quantum, advanced materials, biotechnology, and telecommunications,” Banerjee stated.

He observed that the visit is also significant as we see new areas where industry on both sides would benefit significantly from the outcomes.

“This also creates an enabling environment for the private sectors on both sides to flourish in the spirit of true partnerships. This visit is especially significant, as it would help create greater play of manufacturing in India, FDI flows and naturally, more employment,” Banerjee said.

Another industry body Assocham said the Prime Minister's visit has taken India-US strategic and commercial relations to greater heights, paving the way for immense opportunities for bilateral engagement.

“Prime Minister’s visit is being viewed as a turning point in Indo-US relations in a fast-changing world order which would see both the countries emerge as the most influential economies with strategic prowess in the unfolding international political economy,’‘ Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood said.

Relations between India and the United States date back to India's independence movement and have continued well after independence from the United Kingdom in 1947. Currently, India and the United States enjoy close relations and have deepened collaboration on issues such as counterterrorism and countering Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific.[1]

In 1954, the United States made Pakistan a Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) ally. As a result, India cultivated strategic and military relations with the Soviet Union to counter Pakistan–United States relations.[2] In 1961, India became a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement to abstain from aligning with either the US or the USSR in the Cold War.[3] The Nixon administration's support for Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 affected relations until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In the 1990s, Indian foreign policy adapted to the unipolar world and India developed closer ties with the United States.[4]

In the twenty-first century, Indian foreign policy has sought to leverage India's strategic autonomy to safeguard sovereign rights and promote national interests within a multi-polar world.[5][6] Under the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush (2001–09) and Barack Obama (2009–2017), the United States has demonstrated accommodation to India's core national interests and acknowledged outstanding concerns.[7] Increase in bilateral trade and investment, co-operation on global security matters, inclusion of India in decision-making on matters of global governance (United Nations Security Council), upgraded representation in trade and investment forums (World Bank, IMF, APEC), admission into multilateral export control regimes (MTCR, Wassenaar Arrangement, Australia Group) and support for admission in the Nuclear Suppliers Group and joint-manufacturing through technology sharing arrangements have become key milestones and a measure of speed and advancement on the path to closer US–India relations.[8][9] In 2016, India and the United States signed the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement[10][11] and India was declared a Major Defense Partner of the United States.[12] India and the United States have also stepped up their cooperation among multilateral groups such as The Quad and I2U2 Group.[13]

Gallup's annual World Affairs survey shows India is perceived by Americans as their sixth favorite nation in the world, with 71% of Americans viewing India favorably in 2015,[14] and 70% in 2023.[15] Gallup polls found that 74% of Americans viewed India favorably in 2017,[16] 72% in 2019,[17] 75% in 2020[18] and 77% in 2022.[19] According to a Morning Consult poll conducted in August 2021 after the fall of Afghanistan, 79% of Indians viewed the United States favorably, compared to 10% who viewed the United States unfavorably, the highest percentage out of all 15 major countries surveyed, more favorable than even how most Americans viewed the United States.[20]

History [ edit ]

American Revolution and the East India Company [ edit ]

Great Britain and France had territories in the Americas as well as the Indian subcontinent.[when?] In 1778, when France declared war against Britain, fighting broke out between British and French colonies in India.[21] This marked the beginning of the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Hyder Ali, the Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore, allied himself with the French. From 1780 to 1783, Franco-Mysorean forces fought in several campaigns against the British in western and southern India, in several places such as Mahé and Mangalore.[22]

On June 29, with both sides weakened, the British dispatched HMS Medea to surrender, with letters to the French stating the American Revolutionary War was over.[23] The Treaty of Paris was drafted on 30 November 1782, months before the Siege of Cuddalore but news did not reach India until seven months later, due to the delay of communications to India. The treaty was finally signed on 3 September 1783 and was ratified by the U.S. Congress a few months later. Under the terms of the treaty, Britain returned Pondicherry back to the French and Cuddalore was returned to the British.[22]

The flag of the East India Company is said to have inspired the Grand Union Flag of 1775, ultimately inspiring the current flag of the United States, as both flags were of the same design.[24] Mysorean rockets were also used in the Battle of Baltimore, and are mentioned in ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", the national anthem of the United States: And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air.[25]

Under British Raj (1858–1947) [ edit ]

The relationships between India in the days of the British Raj and the United States were thick.[26] Swami Vivekananda promoted Yoga and Vedanta in the United States at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, during the World's Fair in 1893. Mark Twain visited India in 1896[27] and described it in his travelogue Following the Equator with both revulsion and attraction before concluding that India was the only foreign land he dreamed about or longed to see again.[28] Regarding India, Americans learned more from English writer Rudyard Kipling.[29] Mahatma Gandhi had an important influence on the philosophy of non-violence promoted by American civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1950s.[30]

In the 1930s and early-1940s, Roosevelt voiced strong support to the Indian independence movement despite being allies with Britain.[31][32] The first significant immigration from India before 1965 involved Sikh farmers going to California in the early-twentieth century.[33]

During World War II [ edit ]

During World War II, 1941-1945, India became the main base for the American China Burma India Theater (CBI) in the war against Japan. Tens of thousands of American servicemen arrived, bringing all sorts of advanced technology, and currency; they left in 1945. Serious tension erupted over American demands, led by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, that India be given independence, a proposition Churchill vehemently rejected. For years, Roosevelt encouraged British disengagement from India. The American position was based on an opposition to Europeans having colonies and a practical concern for the outcome of the war, and the expectation of a large American role in a post-independence era. Churchill threatened to resign if Roosevelt continued to push his case, causing Roosevelt to back down.[34][35] Meanwhile, India became the main American staging base to fly aid to China. During World War II, the Panagarh Airport in Bengal Province of India was used as a supply transport airfield from 1942 to 1945 by the United States Army Air Forces Tenth Air Force and as a repair and maintenance depot for B-24 Liberator heavy bombers by Air Technical Service Command.[36][37]

Post Independence (1947–1997) [ edit ]

The United States under the Truman administration leaned towards favouring India in the late-1940s as a consequence of most U.S. planners seeing India more valuable diplomatically than neighboring Pakistan.[38] However, during the Cold War, Nehru's policy of neutrality was cumbersome to many American observers. American officials perceived India's policy of non-alignment negatively. Ambassador Henry F. Grady told then-Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that the United States did not consider neutrality to be an acceptable position. Grady told the State Department in December 1947 that he had informed Nehru ""that this is a question that cannot be straddled and that India should get on the democratic side immediately"".[39] In 1948, Nehru rejected American suggestions for resolving the Kashmir crisis via third party mediation.[40]

Nehru's 1949 tour of the United States was ""an undiplomatic disaster"" that left bad feelings on both sides.[41] Nehru and his top aide V. K. Krishna Menon discussed whether India should ""align with United States 'somewhat' and build up our economic and military strength.""[42] The Truman administration was quite favorable and indicated it would give Nehru anything he asked for. Nehru refused, and thereby forfeited the chance for a gift of one million tons of wheat.[43] The American Secretary of State Dean Acheson recognized Nehru's potential world role but added that he was ""one of the most difficult men with whom I have ever had to deal.""[44] The American visit had some benefits in that Nehru gained widespread understanding and support for his nation, and he himself gained a much deeper understanding of the American outlook.[45]

India rejected the American advice that it should not recognize the Communist conquest of China, but it did back the US when it supported the 1950 United Nations resolution condemning North Korea's aggression in the Korean War. India tried to act as a mediator to help end the war, and served as a conduit for diplomatic messages between the US and China. Although no Indian troops took part in the war, India did send a Medical Corps of 346 army doctors to help the UN side.[46] Meanwhile, poor harvests forced India to ask for American aid for its food security, which was given starting in 1950.[47] In the first dozen years of Indian independence (1947–59), the US provided $1.700,000,000 in aid; including $931,000,000 in food. The Soviet Union provided about half as much in monetary terms, however made much larger contributions in kind, taking the form of infrastructural aid, soft loans, technical knowledge transfer, economic planning and skills involved in the areas of steel mills, machine building, hydroelectric power and other heavy industries, especially nuclear energy and space research.[48] In 1961, the U.S. pledged $1,000,000,000 in development loans, in addition to $1,300,000,000 of free food.[49] To ease the tensions, Eisenhower sent John Sherman Cooper as ambassador in 1956–57. Cooper got along very well with Nehru.[50]

In terms of rhetoric, Jawaharlal Nehru—as both prime minister and foreign minister (1947–64), promoted a moralistic rhetoric attacking both the Soviet bloc and the U.S. and its bloc. Instead Nehru tried to build a nonaligned movement, paying special attention to the many new nations in the Third World released from European colonial status at this time. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his Secretary of State John Foster Dulles themselves used moralistic rhetoric to attack the evils of Communism.[51]

In 1959, Eisenhower became the first U.S. president to visit India to strengthen the staggering ties between the two nations. He was so supportive that the New York Times remarked, ""It did not seem to matter much whether Nehru had actually requested or been given a guarantee that the US would help India to meet further Chinese Communist aggression. What mattered was the obvious strengthening of Indian–American friendship to a point where no such guarantee was necessary.""[52]

During John F. Kennedy's presidency from 1961 to 1963, India was considered a strategic partner and counterweight to the rise of Communist China. Kennedy said,[53]

Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last 10 years. India has been making some progress, but if India does not succeed with her 450 million people, if she can't make freedom work, then people around the world are going to determine, particularly in the underdeveloped world, that the only way they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.

Relations took a nosedive when India annexed the Portuguese colony of Goa in 1961, in which the Kennedy administration condemned the armed action of the Indian government and demanded that all Indian forces be unconditionally withdrawn from Goan soil, at the same time, cutting all foreign aid appropriation to India by 25 percent.[54] In response, Menon, now the Minister of Defence, lectured Kennedy on the importance of US-Soviet compromise and dismissed the admonishments of Kennedy and Stevenson as ""vestige(s) of Western imperialism"".[55] The Kennedy administration openly supported India during the 1962 Sino-Indian war and considered the Chinese action as ""blatant Chinese Communist aggression against India"".[56][57] The United States Air Force flew in arms, ammunition and clothing supplies to the Indian troops and the United States Navy sent the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier from the Pacific Ocean to India, though it was recalled before it reached the Bay of Bengal since the crisis had passed.[58][59] In a May 1963 National Security Council meeting, the United States discussed contingency planning that could be implemented in the event of another Chinese aggression on India. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and General Maxwell Taylor advised the president to use nuclear weapons should the Americans intervene in such a situation. Kennedy insisted that Washington defend India as it would any ally, saying, ""We should defend India, and therefore we will defend India.""[60][61] Kennedy's ambassador to India was the noted liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who was considered close to India.[62] While in India, Galbraith helped establish one of the first Indian computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. As an economist, he also presided over the (at the time) largest US foreign aid program to any country.[citation needed]

1965 - 1992 [ edit ]

Following the assassination of Kennedy in 1963, India-US relations deteriorated gradually. While Kennedy's successor Lyndon B. Johnson sought to maintain relations with India to counter Communist China, he also sought to strengthen ties with Pakistan with the hopes of easing tensions with China and weakening India's growing military buildup as well.[63] Relations then hit an all-time low under the Nixon administration in the early 1970s. Nixon shifted away from the neutral stance which his predecessors had taken towards India-Pakistan hostilities. He established a very close relationship with Pakistan, aiding it militarily and economically, as India, now under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, was leaning towards Soviet Union. He considered Pakistan as a very important ally to counter Soviet influence in the Indian subcontinent and establish ties with China, with whom Pakistan was very close.[64][non-primary source needed] The frosty personal relationship between Nixon and Indira further contributed to the poor relationship between the two nations.[65] During the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, the US openly supported Pakistan and deployed its aircraft carrier USS Enterprise towards the Bay of Bengal, which was seen as a show of force by the US in support of the West Pakistani forces.[66] Later in 1974, India conducted its first nuclear test, Smiling Buddha, which was opposed by the US, however it also concluded that the test did not violate any agreement and proceeded with a June 1974 shipment of enriched uranium for the Tarapur reactor.[67][68]

In the late 1970s, with the Janata Party leader Morarji Desai becoming the prime minister, India improved its relations with the US, led by Jimmy Carter, despite the latter signing an order in 1978 barring nuclear material from being exported to India due to India's non-proliferation record.[69]

Despite the return of Indira Gandhi to power in 1980, the relations between the two countries continued to improve gradually, although India did not support the United States in its role in the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. Indian Foreign Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao expressed ""grave concern"" over the United States's decision to ""rearm"" Pakistan; the two countries were working closely together to counter the Soviets in Afghanistan.[70] The Reagan administration led by US President Ronald Reagan provided limited assistance to India. India sounded out Washington on the purchase of a range of US defence technology, including F-5 aircraft, super computers, night vision goggles and radars. In 1984, Washington approved the supply of selected technology to India including gas turbines for naval frigates and engines for prototypes for India's light combat aircraft. There were also unpublicised transfers of technology, including the engagement of a US company, Continental Electronics, to design and build a new VLF communications station at Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, which was commissioned in the late 1980s.[71]

1993 - 1997 [ edit ]

Under Bill Clinton (President 1993–2001) and P. V. Narasimha Rao (Prime Minister 1991–1996) both sides mishandled relations, according to Arthur G. Rubinoff. Clinton simultaneously pressured India to liberalize its economy while criticizing New Delhi on human rights and nuclear issues. In the face of criticism from Washington and opposition at home, Indian leaders lost their enthusiasm for rapprochement and reverted to formalistic protocol over substantive diplomacy. The Brown Amendment that restored American aid to Pakistan in 1995 was an irritant. In returning to a Cold War style rhetoric, Indian parliamentarians and American congressmen demonstrated their unwillingness to establish a new relationship.[72][73]

NDA I and II governments (1998–2004) [ edit ]

Soon after Atal Bihari Vajpayee became Indian prime minister, he authorised nuclear weapons testing at Pokhran. The United States strongly condemned this testing, promised sanctions, and voted in favor of a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the tests. President Bill Clinton imposed economic sanctions on India, including cutting off all military and economic aid, freezing loans by American banks to state-owned Indian companies, prohibiting loans to the Indian government for all except food purchases, prohibiting American aerospace technology and uranium exports to India, and requiring the US to oppose all loan requests by India to international lending agencies.[74] However, these sanctions proved ineffective – India was experiencing a strong economic rise, and its trade with the US only constituted a small portion of its GDP. Only Japan joined the US in imposing direct sanctions, while most other nations continued to trade with India. The sanctions were soon lifted. Afterward, the Clinton administration and Prime Minister Vajpayee exchanged representatives to help rebuild relations.[75]

In March 2000, Clinton visited India, undertaking bilateral and economic discussions with Vajpayee. This would mark the first U.S. presidential trip to India since 1978.[76] During the visit, the Indo-US Science & Technology Forum was established.[77]

Over the course of improved diplomatic relations with the Bush administration, India agreed to allow close international monitoring of its nuclear weapons development, although it has refused to give up its current nuclear arsenal.[78] In 2004, the US decided to grant Major non-NATO ally (MNNA) status to Pakistan. The US extended the MNNA strategic working relationship to India but the offer was turned down.[79][80]

After the September 11 attacks against the US in 2001, President George W. Bush collaborated closely with India in controlling and policing the strategically critical Indian Ocean sea lanes from the Suez Canal to Singapore.[75]

UPA I and II governments (2004–2014) [ edit ]

During the George W. Bush administration, relations between India and the United States blossomed, primarily over common concerns regarding growing Islamic extremism, energy security, and climate change.[81] George W. Bush commented, ""India is a great example of democracy. It is very devout, has diverse religious heads, but everyone is comfortable about their religion. The world needs India"".[82] Journalist Fareed Zakaria, in his book The Post-American World, described Bush as ""being the most pro-Indian president in American history.""[83] Similar sentiments are echoed by Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of Indian foreign policy and ideologue of Indian National Congress – the largest constituent of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). According to Laskar, the UPA rule has seen a ""transformation in bilateral ties with the US"", as a result of which the relations now covers ""a wide range of issues, including high technology, space, education, agriculture, trade, clean energy, counter-terrorism, etc"".[84]

After the December 2004 tsunami, the US and Indian navies cooperated in search and rescue operations and in the reconstruction of affected areas.[85]

Since 2004, Washington and New Delhi have been pursuing a ""strategic partnership"" that is based on shared values and generally convergent geopolitical interests. Numerous economic, security, and global initiatives, including plans for civilian nuclear cooperation, are underway. First launched in 2005, cooperation on nuclear weapons reversed three decades of American non-proliferation policy. Also in 2005, United States and India signed a ten-year defense framework agreement, with the goal of expanding bilateral security cooperation. The two countries engaged in numerous and unprecedented combined military exercises, and major US arms sales to India were concluded.[citation needed] An Open Skies Agreement was signed in April 2005, enhancing trade, tourism, and business via the increased number of flights,[citation needed] and Air India purchased 68 US Boeing aircraft at a cost of $8 billion.[86][non-primary source needed] The United States and India also signed a bilateral Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation in 2005.[87] After Hurricane Katrina, India donated $5 million to the American Red Cross and sent two planeloads of relief supplies and materials to help.[88] Then, on 1 March 2006, President Bush made another diplomatic visit to further expand relations between India and the U.S.[89]

The value of all bilateral trade tripled from 2004 to 2008 and continued to grow, while significant two-way investment also grows and flourishes.[90][non-primary source needed]

The political influence of a large Indian-American community is reflected in the largest country-specific caucus in the United States Congress,[91] while between 2009 and 2010 more than 100,000 Indian students have attended American colleges and universities.[92]

In November 2010, President Barack Obama visited India and addressed a joint session of the Indian Parliament,[93] where he backed India's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.[94]

Strategic and military determinants [ edit ]

In March 2009, the Obama administration cleared the US$2.1 billion sale of eight P-8 Poseidons to India.[95] This deal, and the $5 billion agreement to provide Boeing C-17 military transport aircraft and General Electric F414 engines announced during Obama's November 2010 visit, made the US one of the top three military suppliers to India (after Israel and Russia).[96] Indians have raised concerns about contract clauses forbidding the offensive deployment of these systems.[97][additional citation(s) needed] India is trying to resolve performance-related issues on the Boeing P-8I that have already been delivered to India.[98][99][needs update]

US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen encouraged stronger military ties between the two nations, and said that ""India has emerged as an increasingly important strategic partner [of the US]"".[100] US Undersecretary of State William J. Burns also said, ""Never has there been a moment when India and America mattered more to each other.""[101] The Deputy Secretary of Defense, Ashton Carter, during his address to the Asia Society in New York City on August 1, 2012, said that India–US relationship has a global scope, in terms of the reach and influence of both countries. He also said that both countries are strengthening the relations between their defense and research organizations.[102]

U.S. spying revelations [ edit ]

India, in July and November 2013, demanded that the U.S. respond to allegations that the Indian UN mission in New York City and the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C. had been targeted for spying.[103]

On July 2, 2014, U.S. diplomats were summoned by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs to discuss allegations that the National Security Agency had spied upon private individuals and political entities within India.[104][105] A 2010 document leaked by Edward Snowden and published by The Washington Post revealed that US intelligence agencies had been authorized to spy on the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (who was then the chief minister of Gujarat).[106][107]

WikiLeaks revelations that Western intelligence agencies have used foreign aid workers and staff at non-governmental organizations as non-official cover prompted India to step-up the monitoring of satellite phones and movement of personnel working for humanitarian relief organisations and development aid agencies in the vicinity of sensitive locations.[108][109]

Foreign policy issues [ edit ]

According to some analysts,[who?] India–U.S. relations have been strained over the Obama administration's approach to Pakistan and the handling of the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan.[110][additional citation(s) needed] India's National Security Adviser M. K. Narayanan criticized the Obama administration for linking the Kashmir dispute to the instability in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and said that by doing so, President Obama was ""barking up the wrong tree.""[111] Foreign Policy in February 2009 also criticized Obama's approach to South Asia, saying that ""India can be a part of the solution rather than part of the problem"" in South Asia. It also suggested that India take a more proactive role in rebuilding Afghanistan, irrespective of the attitude of the Obama administration.[112] In a clear indication of the growing rift between the two countries, India decided not to accept a US invitation to attend a conference on Afghanistan at the end of February 2009.[citation needed] Bloomberg has also reported that, since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the public mood in India has been to pressure Pakistan more aggressively to take actions against the culprits behind the terrorist attack, and that this might reflect on the upcoming Indian general elections in May 2009. Consequently, the Obama administration may find itself at odds with India's rigid stance against terrorism.[113]

In the early 2010s, India and US governments have differed on a variety of regional issues ranging from India's cordial relations with Iran and Russia to foreign policy disagreements relating to Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar and Bangladesh[citation needed].

Robert Blake, Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, dismissed any concerns over a rift with India regarding American AfPak policy. Calling India and the United States ""natural allies"",[114] Blake said that the United States cannot afford to meet the strategic priorities in Pakistan and Afghanistan at ""the expense of India"".[115]

India criticized the Obama administration's decision to limit H-1B (temporary) visas, and India's then External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee (later, the president of India until 2017) said that India would oppose US ""protectionism"" at various international forums.[116] India's Commerce Minister Kamal Nath said that India may move against Obama's outsourcing policies at the World Trade Organization.[117] However, the outsourcing advisory head of KPMG said that India had no reason to worry, since Obama's statements were directed against ""outsourcing being carried out by manufacturing companies"" and not outsourcing of IT-related services.[118][relevant?]

In May 2009, Obama reiterated his anti-outsourcing views and criticized the current US tax policy ""that says you should pay lower taxes if you create a job in Bangalore, India, than if you create one in Buffalo, New York.""[119] However, during the US India Business Council meeting in June 2009, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advocated for stronger economic ties between India and the United States. She also rebuked protectionist policies, saying that ""[United States] will not use the global financial crisis as an excuse to fall back on protectionism. We hope India will work with us to create a more open, equitable set of opportunities for trade between our nations.""[120]

In June 2010, the United States and India formally re-engaged the US-India Strategic Dialogue initiated under President Bush when a large delegation of high-ranking Indian officials, led by External Affairs Minister S. M. Krishna, visited Washington, D.C. As leader of the US delegation, Secretary of State Clinton lauded India as ""an indispensable partner and a trusted friend"".[121] President Obama appeared briefly at a United States Department of State reception to declare his firm belief that America's relationship with India ""will be one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century.""[122] The Strategic Dialogue produced a joint statement in which the two countries pledged to ""deepen people-to-people, business-to-business, and government-to-government linkages ... for the mutual benefit of both countries and for the promotion of global peace, stability, economic growth and prosperity.""[123] It outlined extensive bilateral initiatives in ten key areas: (1) advancing global security and countering terrorism, (2) disarmament and nonproliferation, (3) trade and economic relations, (4) high technology, (5) energy security, clean energy, and climate change, (6) agriculture, (7) education, (8) health, (9) science and technology, and (10) development.[124]

In November 2010, Obama became the second US president (after Richard Nixon in 1969) to undertake a visit to India in his first term in office. On 8 November, Obama also became the second US president (after Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959) to ever address a joint session of the Parliament of India. In a major policy shift, Obama declared US support for India's permanent membership on the UN Security Council.[125][126] Calling the India–U.S. relationship ""a defining partnership of the 21st century"", he also announced the removal of export control restrictions on several Indian companies, and concluded trade deals worth $10 billion, which are expected to create and/or support 50,000 jobs in the US.[127]

Devyani Khobragade incident [ edit ]

In December 2013, Devyani Khobragade, the Deputy Consul General of India in New York, was arrested and accused by U.S. federal prosecutors of submitting false work visa documents and paying her housekeeper ""far less than the minimum legal wage.""[128] The ensuing incident caused protests from the Indian government and a rift in relations, with outrage expressed that Khobragade was strip-searched and held in the general inmate population.[128] Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that Khobragade's treatment was ""deplorable"".[129]

India demanded an apology from the U.S. over her alleged ""humiliation"" and called for the charges to be dropped, which the U.S. declined to do.[130] The Indian government retaliated for what it viewed as the mistreatment of its consular official by revoking the ID cards and other privileges of U.S. consular personnel and their families in India and removing security barriers in front of the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi.[131]

The Indian government also blocked non-diplomats from using the American Community Support Association (ACSA) club and American Embassy Club in New Delhi, ordering these social clubs to cease all commercial activities benefiting non-diplomatic personnel by 16 January 2014.[132] The ACSA club operates a bar, bowling alley, swimming pool, restaurant, video rentals club, indoor gym and a beauty parlour within the embassy premises.[133][134] Tax-free import clearances given to US diplomats and consular officials for importing food, alcohol and other domestic items were revoked with immediate effect. U.S. embassy vehicles and staff were no longer immune from penalties for traffic violations. American diplomats were asked to show work contracts for all domestic help (cooks, gardeners, drivers and security staff) employed within their households.[135] Indian authorities also conducted an investigation into the American Embassy School.[136][137][138]

Nancy J. Powell, the U.S. ambassador to India, resigned following the incident, which was widely seen by India ""as fallout from the imbroglio.""[139] Some commentators suggested that the incident and response could lead to wider damage in U.S.–India relations.[140][141] Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha called for the arrest of same-sex companions of US diplomats, citing the Supreme Court of India's upholding of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code whereby homosexuality is illegal in India.[142][143] Former State Department legal advisor John Bellinger questioned whether the decision to arrest and detain Khobragade was ""wise policy ... even if technically permissible"" under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, while Robert D. Blackwill, the former U.S. ambassador to India from 2001 to 2003, said the incident was ""stupid.""[144][145] Nevertheless, within a year of the incident, U.S.-India relations were warming again, as U.S. President Obama visited India in January 2015.[139]

Relationship between US Government and Narendra Modi (2001–2014) [ edit ]

Sectarian violence during the 2002 Gujarat riots damaged relations between the US Government and Narendra Modi, then incumbent chief minister of Gujarat. Human rights activists accused Modi of fostering anti-Muslim violence and persistently violating human rights agreements. New York based non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch, in their 2002 report directly implicated Gujarat state officials in the violence against Muslims.[146]

In 2012, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the Indian Supreme Court found no ""prosecutable evidence"" against Modi.[147][148] The Court absolved Modi of any criminal wrongdoing during the riots.

In 2005, the US Department of State used a 1998 International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA) provision to revoke Modi's tourist/business visa citing section 212 (a) (2) (g) of the US Immigration and Nationality Act.[149] The IRFA provision ""makes any foreign government official who 'was responsible for or directly carried out, at any time, particularly severe violations of religious freedom' ineligible for a visa to the United States.""

Prior to Narendra Modi becoming the Prime Minister of India, the US Government had made it known that Modi as Chief Minister of Gujarat would not be permitted to travel to the US. Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center opined that although technically speaking there was no US 'visa ban' from 2005 to 2014, the US government policy of considering Modi as persona non grata had resulted in a de facto travel-ban.[150] After the US revoked his existing B1/B2 visa in 2005 and refused to accept his application for an A2 visa, the US State Department affirmed that the visa policy remained unchanged : ""(Mr Modi) is welcome to apply for a visa and await a review like any other applicant"".[151][152]

Exploring opportunities on how to move the relationship out of a state of morose, Lisa Curtis, senior research fellow for South Asia in the Asian Studies Center of The Heritage Foundation, says that, ""the U.S. must first signal its willingness and commitment to collaborating with the new government—and that it will not dwell on the controversy of the 2002 Gujarat riots, which led the U.S. to revoke Modi's visa in 2005.""[153]

In 2009, the U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) report[154] after ignoring the views and decision of independent body (SIT) set up by India's highest judiciary[155] vehemently alleged that there was ""significant evidence"" linking Narendra Modi to communal riots in the state in 2002 and asked the Obama administration to continue the policy of preventing him from travelling to the United States of America .[156][157]

The Obama administration maintained the 2005 decision taken by the George W. Bush administration to deny Narendra Modi entry into the United States of America.[158] The US Government says that Modi can circumvent the USCIRF sanctions regime by visiting Washington on a Heads of government A1-visa as long as he is the Prime Minister of India.[159] According to US State Department Spokesperson, Jen Psaki : ""US law exempts foreign government officials, including heads of state and heads of government from certain potential inadmissibility grounds"". The visa refusal came after some Indian-American groups and human rights organizations with political view campaigned against Modi, including the Coalition Against Genocide.[160]

On June 11, 2014, Robert Blackwill, the former Coordinator for Strategic Planning and Deputy US National Security Advisor during the presidency of George W. Bush, spoke at length about India–U.S. relations and said : ""Mr Modi is a determined leader. He is candid and frank. I also worked with him during the Gujarat earthquake when I was posted as (the US) ambassador to India. ... It was mistake by the current Obama administration to delay engagement with Mr Modi. I do not know why they did so but definitely, this did not help in building relationship. ... The old formula and stereotypes will not work if the US administration wants to engage with Mr Modi. The Indian prime minister is candid, direct and smart. He speaks his mind. The US administration also has to engage in candid conversation when Mr Modi meets President Obama later this year. They have to do something innovative to engage with him.""[161]

Nicholas Burns, former U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs from 2005 to 2008, has spoken about the visa denial by saying: ""Bush administration officials, including me, believed this to be the right decision at the time.""[162][163] and has opined that ""Now that it looks like Modi will become prime minister, it's reasonable for the Obama administration to say it's been 12 years [since the 2002 riots], and we'll be happy to deal with him""[164]

NDA government (2014–present) [ edit ]

India–United States relations have improved significantly during the Premiership of Narendra Modi since 2014.[165] At present, India and the US share an extensive and expanding cultural, strategic, military, and economic relationship[166][167][168] which is in the phase of implementing confidence building measures (CBM) to overcome the legacy of trust deficit – brought about by adversarial US foreign policies[169][170] and multiple instances of technology denial[171][172][173] – which have plagued the relationship over several decades.[174] Unrealistic expectations after the conclusion of the 2008 U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement, which underestimated negative public opinion regarding the long-term viability of nuclear power generation and civil-society endorsement for contractual guarantees on safeguards and liability, has given way to pragmatic realism and refocus on areas of cooperation which enjoy favourable political and electoral consensus[citation needed].

Key recent developments include the rapid growth of India's economy, closer ties between the Indian and American industries especially in the Information and communications technology (ICT), engineering and medical sectors, an informal entente to manage an increasingly assertive China, robust cooperation on counter-terrorism, the deterioration of U.S.-Pakistan relations, easing of export controls over dual-use goods & technologies (99% of licenses applied for are now approved),[175] and reversal of long-standing American opposition to India's strategic program.

Income creation in the USA through knowledge-based employment by Asian Indians has outpaced every other ethnic group according to U.S. Census data.[176] Growing financial and political clout of the affluent Asian Indian diaspora is noteworthy. Indian American households are the most prosperous in the US with a median revenue of US$100,000 and are followed by Chinese Americans at US$65,000. The average household revenue in the USA is US$63,000.[177]

The US and India continue to differ on issues ranging from trade to civil liberties. The Indian Home Ministry, through an affidavit submitted to the Delhi High Court on 13 February 2015, claimed that Country Reports on Rights & Practices have become instruments of foreign policy: ""The US, UK and EU have clearly mentioned in government documents and pronouncements that these reports are made for the purpose of their being used as instruments of foreign policy.""[citation needed] The affidavit also claimed that the reports by US, UK and European Parliament were biased since they ""do not provide opportunity to the Government of India or the local embassy/high commission to record their opinion and are heavily biased against the targeted country"".[178] The 2014 State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report appeared to classify the Khobragade incident as an example of human trafficking, stating: ""An Indian consular officer at the New York consulate was indicted in December 2013 for visa fraud related to her alleged exploitation of an Indian domestic worker.""[179] In response, India has shown no urgency to allow visits to India by the newly appointed US anti-human trafficking ambassador Susan P. Coppedge and the US special envoy for LGBT rights Randy Berry. Under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code homosexuality was illegal in India. Indian Ambassador to the US, Arun K. Singh reiterated India's commitment to work within an international framework to tackle the problem of trafficking but rejected any ""unilateral assessments"" by another country saying ""We will never accept it"" and downplayed the importance of the visits: ""When you ask a U.S. official when somebody will be given a visa, they always say 'we will assess when visa is applied for.' ... I can do no better than to reiterate the U.S. position.""[180]

In February 2016, the Obama administration notified the US Congress that it intended to provide Pakistan eight nuclear-capable F-16 fighters and assorted military goods including eight AN/APG-68(V)9 airborne radars and eight ALQ-211(V)9 electronic warfare suites[181][182] despite strong reservations from US lawmakers regarding the transfer of any nuclear weapons capable platforms to Pakistan.[183] Shashi Tharoor, an elected representative from the Congress party in India, questioned the substance of India–U.S. ties: ""I am very disappointed to hear this news. The truth is that continuing to escalate the quality of arms available to an irresponsible regime that has sent terrorists to India, and in the name of anti-terrorism, is cynicism of the highest order"".[184] The Indian Government summoned the US Ambassador to India to convey its disapproval regarding the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan.[185]

Relationship under President Trump (2017-2021) [ edit ]

In February 2017, Indian ambassador to the U.S. Navtej Sarna hosted a reception for the National Governors Association (NGA), which was attended by the Governors of 25 states and senior representatives of 3 more states. This was the first time such an event has occurred. Explaining the reason for the gathering, Virginia Governor and NGA Chair Terry McAuliffe stated that ""India is America's greatest strategic partner"". He further added, ""We clearly understand the strategic importance of India, of India–U.S. relations. As we grow our 21st century economy, India has been so instrumental in helping us build our technology, medical professions. We recognise a country that has been such a close strategic ally of the US. That's why we the Governors are here tonight."" McAuliffe, who has visited India 15 times, also urged other Governors to visit the country with trade delegations to take advantage of opportunities.[186]

In October 2018, India inked the historic agreement worth US$5.43 billion with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence system, one of the most powerful missile defence systems in the world ignoring America's CAATSA act. The U.S. threatened India with sanctions over India's decision to buy the S-400 missile defense system from Russia.[187] The United States also threatened India with sanctions over India's decision to buy oil from Iran.[188] According to the President of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), Mukesh Aghi: ""sanctions would have a disastrous effect on U.S.-India relations for decades to come. In India’s eyes, the United States would once again be regarded as untrustworthy.""[189] The Trump administration avoided sanctioning India for the Russian S-400 missile system, but sanctioned Turkey and China for the same purchases.[190]

President Trump has grown closer to India's BJP government, which shares the same right-wing views, he has repeatedly praised Modi's leadership and avoided any negative criticism of the Indian government's actions on the citizenship and Kashmir disputes.[191][192] The Trump administration is consistent with the Modi administration in combating ""radical Islamic terrorism"",[193] and the US reiterates its support for India's elimination of terrorist training camp in Pakistan.[194][195]

In early 2020, India provided its agreement for terminating an export embargo on a medicinal drug known as hydroxychloroquine amidst the combat against the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, after Trump threatened retaliation against India, if it did not comply with terminating the export embargo on hydroxychloroquine.[196][197]

In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial in Washington, D.C., was vandalised by unknown miscreants on the intervening night of June 2 and 3. The incident prompted the Indian Embassy to register a complaint with law enforcement agencies. Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Indian Ambassador to the United States called the vandalism ""a crime against humanity"".[198][199] U.S. President Donald Trump called the defacement of Mahatma Gandhi's statue a ""disgrace"".[200]

On 21 December 2020, President of the United States Donald Trump awarded Modi with the Legion of Merit for elevating India–United States relations. The Legion of Merit was awarded to Modi along with Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison and former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe, the ""original architects"" of the QUAD.[201][202]

Modi–Biden relationship (2021 onwards) [ edit ]

US-India ties began to strain in April 2021 when India faced a massive spike in COVID-19 infections. The US had invoked the Defense Production Act of 1950 to ban the export of raw materials needed to produce vaccines in order to prioritize domestic vaccine production.[203] According to The Times of India, this also caused an explosion of anti-US sentiment in India, as the U.S. had vaccine reserves and refused to share COVID-19 vaccine patents.[204] This came after a plea by Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India, to lift the embargo on export of raw materials needed to ramp up production of COVID-19 vaccines, was rejected.[197] However, in late April, right after a phone call with Ajit Doval, the National Security Advisor of India, the Biden administration stated it would make raw materials necessary for production of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine available to India, and began to send more than ₹714 crore (equivalent to ₹801 crore or US$100 million in 2023) worth of drug treatments, rapid diagnostic tests, ventilators, personal protective equipment, and mechanical parts needed to manufacture vaccines to India, along with a team of public health experts from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The US also stated that it planned to finance the expansion of Biological E. Limited, an Indian-based COVID-19 vaccine production company.[205][206][207][208] India entered negotiations with the US after it declared that it would share 60 million Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines with the world.[209]

USS John Paul Jones intrusion [ edit ]

The USS John Paul Jones off the coast of California in November 2002

On April 7, 2021, The United States Navy guided missile destroyer USS John Paul Jones sailed through India's Exclusive Economic Zone, without New Delhi's prior consent, then publicly announced the event, causing a diplomatic spat.[210][211] At a time when the United States and India had been deepening relations, such a move had raised eyebrows among the general public in both India and the United States. As per the official statement by the United States Navy's 7th Fleet, ""On April 7, 2021 (local time) USS John Paul Jones (DDG 53) asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law"". India requires prior consent for military exercises or maneuvers in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law. This freedom of navigation operation (""FONOP"") upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international law by challenging India's excessive maritime claims. The Statement further added, ""U.S. Forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows.""[212] The Pentagon defended the 7th Fleet's statement by claiming that the event was consistent with international law.[211]

The Indian Ministry of External Affairs released its statement after much media attention, the statement said, ""The Government of India's stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the Convention does not authorize other States to carry out in the Exclusive Economic Zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or maneuvers, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state"", it further added, ""The USS John Paul Jones was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the Government of USA through diplomatic channels.""[210][213] Former Chief of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy, Admiral Arun Prakash, commented on the event by tweeting ""There is irony here. While India ratified [the] UN Law of the Seas in 1995, the US has failed to do it so far. For the 7th Fleet to carry out FoN missions in Indian EEZ in violation of our domestic law is bad enough. But publicizing it? USN please switch on IFF!"". He further tweeted, ""FoN ops by USN ships (ineffective as they may be) in South China Sea, are meant to convey a message to China that the putative EEZ around the artificial SCS islands is an 'excessive maritime claim.' But what is the 7th Fleet message for India?""[214][215]

Strengthen cooperation in various fields [ edit ]

Although there are certain differences over the war in Ukraine, the United States and India have strengthened cooperation in defense, semiconductors, critical minerals, space, climate, education, healthcare and other fields during the Joe Biden presidency.[216] Biden also called the ties with India is ""one of the defining relationships of the 21st Century"".[217] Modi and Biden reiterated the call for concerted action against all groups identified by the United Nations as terrorist organisations, including Al-Qaeda, ISIS (Daesh), Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Hizb-ul-Mujhahideen (HuM). Also mentioned the Afghan Taliban authorities and Pakistan should to stop terrorism.[218][219] The joint Statement declared,[220]

No corner of human enterprise is untouched by the partnership between our two great countries, which spans the seas to the stars.

Military relations [ edit ]

The U.S. has four ""foundational"" agreements that it signs with its defence partners. The Pentagon describes the agreements as ""routine instruments that the U.S. uses to promote military cooperation with partner-nations"". American officials have stated that the agreements are not prerequisites for bilateral defence co-operation, but would make it simpler and more cost-effective to carry out activities such as refueling aircraft or ships in each other's countries and providing disaster relief.[221] The first of the four agreements, the General Security Of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), was signed by India and the U.S. in 2002. The agreement enables the sharing of military intelligence between the two countries and requires each country to protect the others' classified information.

The second agreement, the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), was signed by the two countries on 29 August 2016. The LEMOA permits the military of either country to use the others' bases for re-supplying or carrying out repairs. The agreement does not make the provision of logistical support binding on either country, and requires individual clearance for each request.[222] The third agreement, Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) was signed during the inaugural 2+2 dialogue in September 2018.[223] It is an India-specific variant of Communications and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) that enables the two countries to share secure communication and exchange information on approved equipment during bilateral and multinational training exercises and operations. The fourth agreement, the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), signed in 2020, permits the exchange of unclassified and controlled unclassified geospatial products, topographical, nautical, and aeronautical data, products and services between India and the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).[224]

Harsh V. Pant, professor of International relations at King's College London, highlighted the importance of India to US strategic planning by saying: ""India is key to the US' ability to create a stable balance of power in the larger Indo-Pacific and at a time of resource constraints, it needs partners like India to shore up its sagging credibility in the region in face of Chinese onslaught."" Robert Boggs, professor of South Asia Studies at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, opines that the US ""overestimates both India's desire to improve the relationship and the benefits doing so would bring"".[225]

As part of America's policies to counter China,[226] one of the Trump administration policies are to make India as one of the major defence partners for which it is in talks with Indian representatives to sell highly technologically advanced predator drones.[227] India has floated a tender to buy 100 multi role fighter aircraft in the Indian MRCA competition (also called Mother of all defence deals), worth around US$15 billion under Narendra Modi's Make in India initiative. Although the deal is yet to be finalised in 2018, the Trump administration pushed for sales of advanced F-16 jet fighters,[228] and F/A-18 Super Hornet.[229]

The Indian Army and US Army conducts an annual training practice called Yudh Abhyas since 2002. In 2022, this exercise was conducted in Uttarakhand.[230]

In June 2015, US defence secretary Ashton Carter visited India and became the first American defence secretary to visit an Indian military command. In December of the same year, Manohar Parrikar became the first Indian defence minister to visit the US Pacific Command.[231]

In March 2016, India rejected a proposal by the US to join naval patrols in the South China Sea alongside Japan and Australia. Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar said: ""India has never taken part in any joint patrol; we only do joint exercises. The question of joint patrol does not arise.""[232]

In January 2017, Peter Lavoy, Senior Director for South Asian Affairs at the U.S. National Security Council, declared that the partnership between India and the United States under Barack Obama's administration had been ""incredibly successful"". Lavoy stated, ""I can tell you quite definitively that due to our partnerships, several terrorism plots were foiled. Indian lives and American lives were saved because of this partnership.""[233][234]

On October 27, 2020, the United States and India signed the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), enabling greater information-sharing and further defense cooperation, to counter China's growing military power in the region.[235] During the 2+2 ministerial dialogue the last agreement of four so-called “foundational agreements” for sharing sensitive information and sales of advanced military hardware.[236]

On August 16, 2022, US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said that Indian defence attaché now has unescorted access to The Pentagon and he also added that this is commencement with our close relationship with India's status as a major defense partner,"" and future added that ""And if you don't think unescorted access to the Pentagon is a big deal, I can't get into The Pentagon without an escort,"".[237]

During Modi's visit in 2023, the US and India agreed that Hindustan Aeronautics would jointly produce GE F-414 jet engines.[238] The two sides also reached an agreement to purchase MQ-9B drones.[216]

Nuclear cooperation [ edit ]

Pokhran tests [ edit ]

In 1998, India tested nuclear weapons which resulted in several U.S., Japanese, and European sanctions on India. India's then defence minister, George Fernandes, said that India's nuclear programme was necessary as it provided a deterrence to potential nuclear threats. Most of the sanctions imposed on India were removed by 2001. India has categorically stated that it will never use weapons first but will retaliate if attacked.

The economic sanctions imposed by the United States in response to India's nuclear tests in May 1998 appeared, at least initially, to seriously damage India-US relations. President Bill Clinton imposed wide-ranging sanctions pursuant to the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act. US sanctions on Indian entities involved in the nuclear industry and opposition to international financial institution loans for non-humanitarian assistance projects in India. The United States encouraged India to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) immediately and without condition. The United States also called for restraint in missile and nuclear testing and deployment by both India and Pakistan. The non-proliferation dialogue initiated after the 1998 nuclear tests has bridged many of the gaps in understanding between the countries.

Easing of Tension [ edit ]

In late September 2001, President Bush lifted sanctions imposed under the terms of the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act following India's nuclear tests in May 1998. A succession of non-proliferation dialogues bridged many of the gaps in understanding between the countries.

In December 2006, the US Congress passed the historic India–United States Civilian Nuclear Agreement|Henry J. Hyde US–India Peaceful Atomic Cooperation Act, which allows direct civilian nuclear commerce with India for the first time in 30 years. US policy had been opposed to nuclear cooperation with India in prior years because India had developed nuclear weapons against international conventions, and had never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NNPT). The legislation clears the way for India to buy US nuclear reactors and fuel for civilian use.

The India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement also referred to as the ""123 Agreement"", signed on October 10, 2008, is a bilateral agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation which governs civil nuclear trade between American and Indian firms to participate in each other's civil nuclear energy sector.[239][240] For the agreement to be operational, nuclear vendors and operators must comply with India's 2010 Nuclear Liability Act which stipulates that nuclear suppliers, contractors and operators must bear financial responsibility in case of an accident.

Prominent industrial accidents (1984 Bhopal chemical-gas disaster and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster) have led to greater scrutiny by civil society into corporate responsibility and financial liability obligations of vendors and operators of critical infrastructure. In 2010, the Indian Parliament voted to pass the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act to address concerns and provide civil liability for nuclear damage and prompt compensation to the victims of a nuclear incident.

On March 27, 2019, India and the US signed an agreement to ""strengthen bilateral security and civil nuclear cooperation"" including the construction of six American nuclear reactors in India.[241]

Post–September 11 [ edit ]

India's contribution to the War on Terror has helped India's diplomatic relations with several countries. Over the past few years, India has held numerous joint military exercises with United States and European nations that have resulted in a strengthened US-India and EU-India bilateral relationship. India's bilateral trade with Europe and US has more than doubled in the last five years.

However, India has not signed the CTBT, or the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, claiming the discriminatory nature of the treaty that allows the five declared nuclear countries of the world to keep their nuclear arsenal and develop it using computer simulation testing. Prior to its nuclear testing, India had pressed for a comprehensive destruction of nuclear weapons by all countries of the world in a time-bound frame. This was not favoured by the United States and by certain other countries. Presently, India has declared its policy of ""no-first use of nuclear weapons"" and the maintenance of a ""credible nuclear deterrence"". The USA, under President George W. Bush has also lifted most of its sanctions on India and has resumed military co-operation. Relations with USA have considerably improved in the recent years, with the two countries taking part in joint naval exercises off the coast of India and joint air exercises both in India as well as in the United States.[242][243][244]

India has been pushing for reforms in the United Nations and in the World Trade Organization with mixed results. India's candidature for a permanent seat at the UN Security Council is currently backed by several countries including Russia, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Brazil, African Union nations and United States. In 2005, the United States signed a nuclear co-operation agreement with India even though the latter is not a part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The United States agreed that India's strong nuclear non-proliferation record made it an exception and persuaded other Nuclear Suppliers Group members to sign similar deals with India.

On March 2, 2006, India and the United States signed the Indo-US Nuclear Pact on co-operation in civilian nuclear field. This was signed during the four days state visit of USA President George Bush in India. On its part, India would separate its civilian and military nuclear programmes, and the civilian programmes would be brought under the safeguards of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The United States would sell India the reactor technologies and the nuclear fuel for setting up and upgrading its civilian nuclear programme. The US Congress needs to ratify this pact since US federal law prohibits the trading of nuclear technologies and materials outside the framework of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).

Economic relations [ edit ]

The United States is one of India's largest direct investors. From 1991 to 2004, the stock of FDI inflow has increased from US$11 million to $344.4 million, and totaling $4.13 billion. This is a compound rate increase of 57.5 percent annually. Indian direct investments abroad began in 1992, and Indian corporations and registered partnership firms now can and do invest in businesses up to 100 percent of their net worth. India's largest outgoing investments are in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 54.8 percent of the country's foreign investments. The second largest are in non-financial services (software development), accounting for 35.4 percent of investments. According to the data of the commerce ministry, in 2021–22, bilateral trade in goods between the two countries crossed $119.42 billion. Exports to the US increased to $76.11 billion in 2021-22 from $51.62 billion in previous fiscal year, while imports rose to $43.31 billion as compared to about $29 billion in 2020–21.[245]

Trade relations [ edit ]

U.S. President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a meeting with Indian and American business leaders in New Delhi in March 2006

The United States is India's largest trading partner since 2021,[245] and India is its 7th largest trading partner.[246] In 2017, the US exported $25.7 billion worth of goods to India, and imported $48.6 billion worth of Indian goods.[247] Major items imported from India include information technology services, textiles, machinery, gems and diamonds, chemicals, iron and steel products, coffee, tea, and other edible food products. Major American items imported by India include aircraft, fertilisers, computer hardware, scrap metal, and medical equipment.[248][249]

The United States is also India's largest investment partner, with a direct investment of $10 billion (accounting for 9 percent of total foreign investment). Americans have made notable foreign investments in the Asian country's power generation, telecommunications, ports, roads, petroleum exploration and processing, and mining industries.[249]

American imports from India amounted to $46.6 billion or 2% of its overall imports, and 15.3% of India's overall exports in 2015. Major commodities exported from India to the US include[250][251] Gems, precious metals and coins, Pharmaceuticals, Oil, Machinery, Textiles (including knit & crochet), Organic chemicals, Vehicles, and Iron or steel products

American exports to India amounted to $20.5 billion or 5.2% of India's overall imports in 2015. Major commodities exported from the US to India include:[252][253] Gems, precious metals and coins, Machinery, Electronic equipment, Medical equipment, Oil, Aircraft/spacecraft, Plastics, Organic chemicals, fruits and nuts.

In July 2005, President Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh created a new programme called the Trade Policy Forum.[254] It is run by a representative from each nation. The United States Trade Representative was Rob Portman, and the Indian Commerce Secretary then-Minister of Commerce Kamal Nath. The goal of the programme is to increase bilateral trade and investment flow. There are five main sub-divisions of the Trade Policy Forum, including The Agricultural Trade group, which has three main objectives: agreeing on terms that will allow India to export mangoes to the United States, permitting India's Agricultural and Process Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) to certify Indian products to the standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and executing regulation procedures for approving edible wax on fruit.

The goals of the Tariff and Non-Tariff Barriers group include agreeing that insecticides manufactured by US companies can be sold throughout India. India had also agreed to cut special regulations on trading carbonated drinks, many medicinal drugs, and lowering regulations on many imports that are not of an agricultural nature. Both nations have agreed to discuss improved facets of Indian regulation in the trade of jewellery, computer parts, motorcycles, fertiliser, and those tariffs that affect American exporting of boric acid. The group has also discussed matters such as those wishing to break into the accounting market, Indian companies gaining licenses for the telecommunications industry, and setting policies regarding Indian media and broadcasting markets. Other foci include the exchange of valuable information on recognizing different professional services, discussing the movement and positioning of people in developing industries, continuation of talks on financial services markets, limitation of equities, insurance, retail, joint investment in agricultural processing and transportation industries, and small business initiatives.

On August 3, 2018, India became the third Asian nation to be granted Strategic Trade Authorization-1 (STA-1) status by the United States. STA-1 enables the export of high-technology products in civil space and defence from the US to India.[255][256]

On February 15, 2023, Air India announced an order of 470 jets, out of which 220 jets would be bought from Boeing and the other 250 from Airbus. This is one of the biggest aircraft orders in the commercial jet industry. The deal was acknowledged by both the POTUS and the PMO of India.[257]

During Modi's visit in 2023, resolution of six of seven outstanding WTO disputes between the US and India through mutually agreed solutions, market access.[216]

Science and technology [ edit ]

On January 31, 2023, the US-India Civil Space Joint Working Group (CSJWG) met for the eighth time. The group is a collaboration of space agencies ISRO and NASA. The CSJWG has planned to launch The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission in 2024 which is expected to map Earth using two different radar frequencies to monitor resources like water, forests, and agriculture.[258]

In January 2023, the national security advisors of India and the U.S. announced the launch of the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET). Under iCET, both sides will work together in the fields of artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, advanced wireless technology, space and semiconductor supply chain resilience.[259]

India signed the Artemis Accords in 2023, joining 26 other countries working on exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond. And NASA will provide advanced training to ISRO astronauts with the goal of launching a joint effort to the International Space Station in 2024.[216]

India-US strategic partnership [ edit ]

U.S. and Indian Army soldiers during the opening ceremony of Yudh Abhyas military exercise in November 2022

India-U.S. relations grew strategically in the early 1960s, as the rise of the People's Republic of China worried policymakers in Washington, D.C.. The Chinese government's assertion in Tibet, its role in the Korean War, and other such acts concerned Washington. As relations between India and China were heated during the late fifties, the Americans found a golden opportunity to take advantage of this situation to promote India as a counterweight to China.[260]

After the end of the Cold War, Indian and American interests converged in a number of areas, including counter-terrorism, promotion of democracy, counter-proliferation, freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean, and the balance of power in Asia.[260]

As the world's oldest and largest democracies, respectively, the U.S. and India share historic ties.[261] India is a founding member of the ""Community of Democracies""—a prominent endeavor of the United States on promotion of democracy. However, India rejected a suggestion by the USA about setting up a Centre for Asian Democracy.[262]

India emerged in the 21st century as increasingly vital to core US foreign policy interests. India, a dominant actor in its region, and the home of more than one billion citizens, is now often characterised as a nascent Great Power and an ""indispensable partner"" of the US, one that many analysts view as a potential counterweight to the growing clout of China.[263]

In a meeting between President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in November 2001, the two leaders expressed a strong interest in transforming the US-India bilateral relationship. High-level meetings and concrete cooperation between the two countries increased during 2002 and 2003. In January 2004, the US and India launched the ""Next Steps in Strategic Partnership"" (NSSP), which was both a milestone in the transformation of the bilateral relationship and a blueprint for its further progress.[264] In July 2005, Bush hosted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Washington, D.C. The two leaders announced the successful completion of the NSSP, as well as other agreements which further enhanced cooperation in the areas of civil nuclear, civil space, and high-technology commerce. Other initiatives announced included a US-India economic dialogue, the fight Against HIV/AIDS, disaster relief, technology cooperation, an agriculture knowledge initiative, a trade policy forum, energy dialogue, CEO Forum, and an initiative to assist each other in furthering democracy and freedom.[265] President Bush made a reciprocal visit to India in March 2006, during which the progress of these initiatives were reviewed, and new initiatives were launched.[89]

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was the guest of honour at the first state dinner of the administration of US President Barack Obama, which took place on 24 November 2009. Obama later visited India from 6–9 November 2010, signing numerous trade and defence agreements with India. He addressed the joint session of the Indian parliament in New Delhi, becoming only the second US president to do so, and announced that the United States would lend its support to India's bid for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, signifying the growing strategic dimension of the relationship between the world's two largest democracies.[266] During US President Trump's visit to India in 2020, both sides agree to establish “Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership”.[267]

In both the 2017 Doklam standoff and the 2020–2021 China–India skirmishes, the United States provided India with intelligence it possessed, and the two sides discussed the crisis on Ladakh border. The US was also involved in securing the release of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman from Pakistani custody following the 2019 Balakot airstrike.[268] The US played a role in extinguishing tensions between India and Pakistan in 2019, when Pakistan and India were at the verge of nuclear war, as per the claim of former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo.[269]

On October 27, 2020, US and India signed a military agreement on sharing sensitive satellite data. The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement, or BECA, allows the US's strategic partners to access a range of sensitive geospatial and aeronautical data which is useful for military actions.[270]

In December 2020, US India Business Council president Nisha Desai Biswal claimed that the ties between the two nations will continue and grow stronger in 2021, as the Biden administration will prioritize their trade deals for a prospering economic relationship.[271]

In December 2022, based on BECA, the United States provided real-time location information of the PLA soldiers to help India rout China, during the confrontation in Arunachal Pradesh.[272]

Tensions over Russian relations [ edit ]

The purchase of S-400 missile system by India, resulted in an imbroglio in the US Congress.[273] Previously, the Trump administration admonished India that it might entice economic sanctions by the United States.[274][275] But since India looms as a counterweight to China, the significance of India is creeping upon the US Senate. Following that, two major Senators John Cornyn from the Republican Party and Mark Warner from the Democratic Party urged president Joe Biden to waive sanctions against New Delhi as it might euthanize the cumulative cooperation with India to maintain the hegemony of the United States of America across the region of South Asia & the Indian Ocean region.[276][277]

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, India abstained on a United Nations resolution showing disapproval of (but not politically condemning) the invasion, saying it was ""deeply disturbed"" by Russia's invasion. Some experts have also pointed out that the reason for India's abstention is because 70% of Indian arms imports are from Russia, 14% from the US, and 5% from Israel.[278] In a meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue on the implications of the crisis for the region, President Biden noted India's abstention, saying that most global allies were united against Russia.[279] Speaking to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, US diplomat Donald Lu said the Biden administration was still considering sanctions against India over its S-400 deal with Russia, and its abstention at the UN.[280] On 15 July 2022, the United States House of Representatives passed a legislative amendment that granted India a waiver from CAATSA-related sanctions connected to the purchase of the S-400; however the amendment has yet to be passed by the United States Senate.[281]

While some officials of Ukraine have called for Western sanctions against India over its heavy buying of Russian oil, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Karen Donfried told reporters in February 2023: ""We are not looking to sanction India. Our partnership with India is one of our most consequential relationships.""[282] In the wake of the Russo-Ukrainian War, the U.S. has ruled out secondary sanctions against India for its considerable oil imports or defence engagement from Russia.[190]

Diplomatic exchanges [ edit ]

Formal visits by counterparts (2014 onwards) [ edit ]

Modi's visit to America, 2014 [ edit ]

During the run-off to the 2014 Indian general election, there was wide-ranging scepticism regarding the future of the India–U.S. strategic relationship. Narendra Modi, whose US visa had been revoked while he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, had been boycotted by US officials for almost a decade[283] for his alleged role in the 2002 Gujarat riots.[284] However, sensing Modi's inevitable victory well before the election, the US Ambassabor Nancy Powell had reached out to him. Moreover, following his 2014 election as the Prime Minister of India President Obama congratulated him over telephone and invited him to visit the US.[285][286] US Secretary of State John Kerry visited New Delhi on 1 August to prepare the grounds for Modi's first ever US visit as Prime Minister. In September 2014, days before visiting the US in an interview to CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Modi said that ""India and the United States are bound together, by history and culture"" but acknowledged that there have been ""ups and downs"" in relations.[287] Modi travelled to US from 27 to 30 September 2014,[288] beginning with his maiden address in the United Nations general assembly followed by attending a gala public reception by the Indian American community in New York's Madison Square Garden before heading Washington, D.C., for the bilateral talk with Obama. While there, Modi also met several American business leaders and invited them to join his ambitious Make in India program in a bid to make India a manufacturing hub.[289][290][291]

Obama's visit to India, 2015 [ edit ]

President Barack Obama became the first US president to be the chief guest of the 66th Republic Day celebrations of India held on 26 January 2015.[292] India and the US held their first ever bilateral dialogue on the UN and multilateral issues in the spirit of the ""Delhi Declaration of Friendship"" that strengthens and expands the two countries' relationship as part of the Post-2015 Development Agenda.[293] The conspicuous absence of major announcements, a key indicator of the state of US relations with the host country, led political commentators in both countries to highlight the confidence-building aspects of the visit.[294][295][296]

Modi's visit to America, 2015 [ edit ]

Prime Minister Narendra Modi toured the Silicon Valley and met with entrepreneurs – several of whom are persons of Indian origin – involved in successful microelectronics, digital communications and biotechnology start-ups to promote the NDA government's Make in India initiative.[297] Modi left the U.S. West Coast and travelled to New York for the 2015 UN General Assembly meeting where he had bilateral discussions with US President Barack Obama.

Modi's visit to America, 2016 [ edit ]

Prime Minister Narendra Modi while visiting the United States addressed a joint session of Congress highlighting the common traits of both democracies and long-term friendship between the two countries.[298] In a speech lasting more than 45 minutes, Mr. Modi drew on parallels between the two countries and addressed a variety of issues where the two countries have worked together in the past and where the future course of action would lie.[299]

Modi's visit to America, 2017 [ edit ]

On June 26, 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the United States and met US President Donald Trump. On 8 November 2017, the US announced a grant of nearly US$500,000 for organisations which came up with ideas and projects to promote religious freedom in India and Sri Lanka.[citation needed]

Modi's visit to America, 2019 [ edit ]

In September 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Houston, where he addressed a large Indian American contingent at NRG Stadium. Along with President Donald Trump, he reaffirmed Indian American ties, with an emphasis on increased military cooperation with the initiation of the Tiger Triumph exercises.[300]

Trump's 2020 visit to India [ edit ]

On February 24, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump visited Ahmedabad, Gujarat to address a large Indian crowd.[301] The event, titled ""Namaste Trump"", was a response to the ""Howdy Modi"" event held in 2019.[302] Attendance of over 100,000 people was reported.[303] The event served as a platform for the U.S. president and the Indian prime minister to show off their friendly relationship.[304]

Trump also visited Agra, Uttar Pradesh and the Taj Mahal on the same day.[305] In Agra, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath welcomed the President and the First Lady. There were 3000 cultural artists showcasing art, cultural & music of various regions.[306] However, political commentators state that Trump's first official visit to India had been overshadowed by the 2020 North East Delhi riots.[307]

Modi's visit to America, 2021 [ edit ]

Modi traveled to US from 22 to 25 September 2021, beginning with his maiden address in the United Nations general assembly before heading Washington, D.C., for the bilateral talk with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. While there, Modi also participated in the Quad Leaders' Summit.

Modi's visit to America, 2023 [ edit ]

Prime Minister Modi traveled to the United States in June 2023.[308] It was Modi's first state visit to the United States, and the second time he has been invited to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress.[309] Modi and President Biden answered questions from reporters at a press conference held in the White House.[310]

The U.S., through the official state visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is looking to convey that the relationship between India and America is of ""positive strategic consequence"", the White House has said.

Prime Minister Modi arrives in Washington DC on a three-day state visit on June 21. The welcome ceremony and the state dinner along with an address to the Joint Session of the US Congress are scheduled for June 22.

Speaking at a panel discussion during the annual 'India Ideas Summit' of the U.S. India Business Council on Tuesday, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer said after years of strengthening ties across administrations, the U.S.-India partnership is deeper and more expensive than ever.

“The main message that we are looking to convey is that this is a relationship of positive strategic consequence,” he said.

“We think we are much more deeply aligned and significantly converging with each other on numerous global issues and innumerable ways we can benefit each of our populations.”

""What you will see when Prime Minister Modi comes and is able to spend some time with President Joe Biden in this setting, is a modern relationship between two significant countries that will benefit their own people,” Mr. Finer said.

He said in just eight days, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden have the honour to receive the Prime Minister of India at the White House for an official state visit and dinner, which is the third such occasion for this administration.

“I can tell you, … how much he's looking forward to it, how much attention to detail is given at the very highest levels for governments and it's good evidence of that,” he said.

The two governments are deepening the strategic convergence, strengthening policy alignment to elevate and expand strategic technology and defence industrial cooperation, Mr. Finer said.

“We really believe that we now look instinctively to each other and more cooperatively, to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific to drive innovation and to jointly tackle global challenges,” the White House official said.

Observing that India and the U.S. are natural partners, Mr. Finer said the two countries are ready to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of this unique moment together.

“Working with other like-minded partners, our countries will shape the future, working towards a world as more open and more prosperous, more secure, more stable, more resilient. This offers a brief overview of the highlights as we see them of the partnership that we are building,” he said.

India, being the major defence partner, saw the two countries consult regularly to assess regional developments and put in place an architecture to cooperate more closely through joint exercises, information sharing, logistics networks and interoperable communication systems, he said.

“We continue to strengthen India's status as a major defence partner through defence industrial cooperation that Co-develops and co-produces important military capabilities for both of our countries,” Mr. Finer said.

“Second, our Strategic Technology Partnership. I know you're all aware of our pathbreaking initiative on critical emerging technologies, ICET, ….which has already catalysing government, business and university cooperation in defence space semiconductors, advanced telecommunications biotechnology, emerging technologies like AI and quantum to foster an open, accessible and secure technology ecosystem,” he said.

Mr. Finer said this technology ecosystem in areas such as 5G will offer other countries beyond just US-India advanced communications alternatives that are consistent with their shared democratic values.

“Third, is our work together on the clean energy transition, the United States and India share a common vision to decarbonise our economies and deploy clean energy, which is obviously reflected in all of our country's 2030 targets for climate action and energy,” he said.

In countries, the energy transition can be more consequential to the world than India and the U.S.

“Together, we are pushing each other to develop and deploy innovative solutions to strengthen climate security, expand peaceful uses of civil nuclear energy and unlock climate finance solutions, to mobilise the information technologies and the resources we need to create the clean energy economy of the future,” Mr. Finer said.

“Fourth, as two of the world's foremost centres of innovation, we are driving prosperity together,” he said, adding that bilateral trade last year was $191 billion, which has nearly doubled since 2014.

India’s G-20 presidency has brought renewed focus on strengthening multilateralism and international cooperation to tackle global challenges, and achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals, he said.

“Fifth, we are welcoming new education partnerships and taking steps to support the growing demand for travel between our countries,"" he said.

The US mission last year issued 125,000 visas to Indian students which is a record, Mr. Finer said, adding that Indian students are on pace soon to become the largest foreign student community in the U.S.

“Our relationship is also grounded in values that are cherished by both our people and our founders: democracy, pluralism tolerance, openness and respect for human rights.”

""These enable us to work together and to work together with civil societies and NGOs, to build a more resilient, more peaceful, more secure, democratic society,” Mr. Finer said."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India will receive a lavish welcome on Thursday in Washington, where he will address a joint session of Congress and be feted by President Biden and the first lady in a state dinner at the White House — only the third state leader to be hosted by the current administration.

Swirling around the pageantry of a momentous visit for U.S.-India relations, seen as an affirmation of India’s rise as an economic and diplomatic power, will be weighty questions of geopolitical alignments with regard to China’s economic influence and Russia’s military aggression, as well as the erosion of India’s secular democracy under Mr. Modi. How much if any of that will be publicly addressed by the two leaders is unclear.

The visit is a significant diplomatic prize for Mr. Modi, who was once denied a visa to the United States for his role in religious riots in his home state, and as prime minister has increasingly consolidated power and edged his country closer to one-party rule."
270,https://time.com/6288459/india-ally-us-modi-biden-visit/,India Is Not a U.S. Ally—and Has Never Wanted to Be,2023-06-21 10:00:03+00:00,"With Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi slated for a June 22 State Visit to Washington, India will, if briefly, be front-page news in the United States. Since President Clinton ended a chill in U.S.-India relations almost 25 years ago, successive American and Indian administrations across political parties have worked to strengthen ties. So it’s fair to ask: how robust is this relationship today? As with the blind men and the elephant, the answer varies. Is India a bad bet, or is it, as the White House senior Asia policy official said recently, “the most important bilateral relationship with the United States on the global stage”?

Despite careful nurturing by Washington over the years, many aspects of U.S. ties with India remain challenging. Bilateral trade has grown tenfold since 2000, to $191 billion in 2022, and India became the ninth-largest US trading partner in 2021. But longstanding economic gripes persist, meriting 13 pages in the 2023 Foreign Trade Barriers report from the U.S. Trade Representative. Multilaterally, India’s role in the fast-consolidating “Quad” consultation (comprised of the United States, Australia, India, and Japan) has brought shared purpose to Washington and New Delhi, both of which harbor concerns about China. But New Delhi also champions alternative non-Western groupings like the BRICS, and it remains outside bodies central to U.S. diplomacy like the U.N. Security Council and the G7.

Today, U.S.-India cooperation spans defense, global health, sustainable development, climate, and technology, among other things. But deep differences remain, including concerns in Washington about India’s democratic backsliding under Modi, and India’s failure to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In other words, the U.S.-India relationship has been transformed over the past quarter-century, but that transformation has not delivered a partnership or alignment similar to the closest U.S. alliances.

This shouldn’t surprise anyone. India is not a U.S. ally, and has not wanted to become one. To see relations with rising power India as on a pathway that culminates in a relationship like that the United States enjoys with Japan or the United Kingdom creates expectations that will not be met. Indian leaders across parties and over decades have long prioritized foreign policy independence as a central feature of India’s approach to the world. That remains the case even with Modi’s openness to the United States.

For India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, protecting his country’s hard-fought independence was a guiding principle for foreign policy. Speaking in the Indian Parliament in March 1951, Nehru noted that “By aligning ourselves with any one Power, you surrender your opinion, give up the policy you would normally pursue because somebody else wants you to pursue another policy.” Twelve years later, evaluating his country’s nonalignment policy in the pages of Foreign Affairs, Nehru went on to observe that it had not “fared badly,” and that “essentially, ‘non-alignment’ is freedom of action which is a part of independence.”

For famously allied Washington, nonalignment in the 20th century was a bridge too far; in 1956 then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles proclaimed that neutrality was “an obsolete conception…immoral and shortsighted.” It did not help matters that the United States had entered an alliance with India’s arch-rival Pakistan in 1954, and sided with the Pakistani military in the bloody civil war that gave birth to Bangladesh in 1971. Nor, too, when Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi signed a “Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Cooperation” with the USSR in 1971, definitively tilting India toward the Soviet Union even as the United States had tilted toward Pakistan.

Especially since the end of the Cold War, Indian leaders have sought to improve ties with Washington, but not by curtailing India’s independent approach to foreign policy. Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee proclaimed India and the United States “natural allies” in a landmark 1998 speech in New York. Yet this was perhaps more a term of art than a call for an alliance as it occurred against the backdrop of India’s nuclear tests, underscoring New Delhi’s willingness to upset global nuclear nonproliferation conventions, which it never joined. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whose 10 years at the helm greatly improved Indo-U.S. relations, pursued a civil-nuclear agreement with Washington and ushered in new cooperation in high technology, defense, and clean energy. But his government too defended its principle of “strategic autonomy” as a redline for its foreign policy even as it moved closer to Washington than ever in the past. Defending the civil-nuclear deal with Washington before Parliament in 2008, Singh twice asserted that “Our strategic autonomy will never be compromised.”

In important ways, Prime Minister Modi represents a break with India’s past, most notably in his emphasis on India’s Hindu, rather than syncretic and secular, cultural heritage. But his approach to the United States remains consistent with the history of his country’s foreign policy independence.

Modi has deepened ties with the United States, now across three U.S. presidents, through increased partnership in defense, in advanced technology, and in energy, just to name a few, as well as through moments of high symbolism, like his 2015 Republic Day invitation to former President Barack Obama, the first time an American president joined this day honoring India’s constitution. Even so, Modi has leaned into the United States while leaning into many other partners around the world. The Modi government invokes a Sanskrit saying, the “world is one family” (vasudhaiva kutumbakam), to frame Indian diplomacy. This approach has been termed “multialignment,” a theory of seeking positive ties as far and as widely as possible, without seeing contradictions in this approach.

In practice, New Delhi has carefully managed its relationships with Saudi Arabia as well as Iran; with Israel as well as the Palestinian Territories; with the United States as well as Russia. India’s G20 presidency this year encapsulates this orientation, with its Sanskritic theme of “One Earth, One Family, One Future,” and its twin efforts to lead the forum for the world’s 20 largest economies while self-consciously presenting itself as the “Voice of the Global South.”

With this history in mind, it’s easier to perceive that momentum in the U.S.-India relationship does not necessarily imply a path to a formal alliance or mutual defense treaty. In the United States, the mental model for positive international cooperation defaults to seeing “ally” as the ultimate endpoint. For India, that suggests a curtailment of independence. And with India, even as cooperation becomes more extensive than ever in the past, consequential differences remain.

For many in Washington, the dramatic growth of coordination and joint activities under the Quad consultative group fills a growing need in light of China’s rise, encompassing subjects as far-flung as maritime security, infrastructure, climate and resilience, vaccines, technology standards, and higher education—all underlining Indian strategic convergence with the United States in the Indo-Pacific. Yet strategic convergence there does not mean everywhere: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its year-long war has elicited a tepid tut-tut from New Delhi, while India has escalated its purchases of cheap Russian oil at a time Washington seeks to isolate Moscow.

On closer examination this foreign policy independence and desire to define its own path so prized by India may offer lessons for U.S. foreign policy. The unipolar moment has passed; in its place we have more actors with their own perspectives, and a rising China with global ambitions and its own priorities increasingly shaping the priorities of others. The array of special relationships and alliances nurtured by the United States over decades are still in place, but many of these are now inflected by divergences with Washington. Take Turkey, or France, or Egypt, Pakistan, or Brazil. These U.S. allies do not always see their alliance relationship with Washington as barriers to taking decisions that contradict U.S. preferences. Indeed, President Emmanuel Macron too invokes “strategic autonomy.”

It’s here that India’s ambivalence offers a lens onto the world Washington is likely to encounter on a growing scale. In this world of more diffused power—a world with more diverse actors taking more distinctive foreign policy steps—partnerships and even alliances marked by substantial disagreements might be the new normal. In fact, managing ambivalence may be the central skill for American foreign policy in the years ahead.

In the first two years of the Modi government, India and the United States have taken calibrated efforts at the highest political level to transform bilateral relations. It was in this context that the visit of United States Defense Secretary Ash Carter to India on 10–13 April assumed huge significance. His visit symbolised the deepening defence ties between the two countries, with the Modi government agreeing in principle to sign three ground-breaking agreements.

The current era of US–India relations began after the Clinton administration’s containment policies failed to isolate India following its 1998 nuclear tests. India emerged from these sanctions a resurgent country under the leadership of prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The United States then adopted a policy of accommodation towards India, with the two countries transforming their estranged relations into a strategic partnership.

When Modi came to power, he did not allow his personal differences with the United States to dictate bilateral ties. Instead, Modi decided to redirect efforts to sustain and deepen ties. This quickly became evident when Modi made a state visit to the United States in September 2014 on the invitation of President Obama. Subsequently, Obama became the first US president to be the chief guest at the Republic Day Parade in New Delhi in January 2015.

Defence cooperation has been a pillar of the two countries’ burgeoning relationship. There is a growing sentiment among US security officials and experts that, given its economic slowdown as well as security crises in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and other regions, it is not possible for the United States alone to ensure peace and security. It needs to engage rising powers like India.

As the Modi government has accelerated the process of military modernisation, buoyed by increased foreign direct investment in the defence sector, Washington sees economic opportunities in deepening defence ties with New Delhi. The rise of China and its assertive posturing in the South China Sea is another reason for the United States to expand security and military relations with India.

India is concerned by China’s position on disputed territories and by the growing nexus between Beijing and Islamabad. New Delhi feels that the presence of the United States in South Asia would help maintain the balance of power in its favour. The Modi government also knows it cannot aggressively pursue military modernisation without access to advanced US weaponry and technology.

Modi’s ambitious ‘Make in India’ initiative would also not be successful without the active participation of the American defence industry, given its expertise in the field. Isolating Pakistan internationally for failing to adequately address terrorism also requires New Delhi to sustain security talks and military exercises with Washington.

Unlike the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, the Modi government has shown a desire to work with the United States in ensuring freedom of navigation and flight throughout the region, including in the South China Sea. This shift in India’s stance is critical as it reflects the government’s determination to take a firm stance on China. This understanding has been reinforced by the Modi government’s special attention to developing triangular and quadrilateral coalitions with the United States, Japan and Australia as a part of its regional security strategy.

Both the United States and India have made significant progress on the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative, an undertaking aimed at reducing the barriers to defence technology cooperation and trade. The countries are also holding talks on the supply of F-16 and F/A-18 fighter jets for the Indian Air Force. These defence deals would give a significant boost to the ‘Make in India’ program.

The Modi government has also pursued three crucial bilateral agreements — the Logistic Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMA), the Communication and Information Security Memorandum (CISMOA) and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA). The previous UPA government opposed these three agreements as they argued that they would undermine India’s strategic autonomy and its policy of nonalignment. But in light of emerging security threats, the Modi government has agreed in principle to all three.

LEMA will allow both countries to access fuel and supplies from each other’s bases, making it easier to coordinate military activities. The agreement would help India in carrying out operations in the Indian Ocean and expanding its maritime reach in the Asia Pacific.

CISMOA will enable the countries to share confidential intelligence in both peacetime and war using advanced encryption technology. BECA would provide India with topographical and aeronautical data as well as products aiding navigation and targeting.

Some concerns have been raised about the possible downsides of signing these agreements. For instance, CISMOA would enable the United States to listen to highly confidential defence conversations within India. There are also fears that under LEMA the United States would pressure India into allotting portions of its land bases for exclusive military use.

It is for these reasons that India has only agreed to sign these agreements in principle. The Modi government has asked the United States to modify the agreements so that India’s security and sovereignty are not compromised. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has made it clear that LEMA does not mention the stationing of American troops on Indian soil. India’s apprehension implies that, while it seeks close defence ties with the United States, the Indian government does not want to unnecessarily draw itself into a tussle between the United States and China.

With the introduction of the US–India Defence Technology and Partnership Act this March and an expected visit by Modi to Washington to address a joint session of the US Congress, the future of the bilateral relationship looks bright. One hopes that this kind of engagement will continue, forging the way for a stronger India–US relationship.

Consider, for example, widespread Western criticism of India’s reluctance to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, accelerated purchases of Russian oil, and continued reliance on Moscow’s arms. These critics might thus have expected the United States to disengage—but instead are surprised by U.S. President Joe Biden’s turn toward closer relations. Biden insists that the United States is in a “ long game ” of engagement with India, one that differences over Ukraine will not be allowed to undermine. Despite India’s ties to Moscow—or rather, because of them—the Biden administration is also going out of its way to help India modernize its defense industry, agreeing to transfer to India one of the U.S. defense sector’s crown jewels: the technology to manufacture fighter jet engines .

Another reason for the dissonance between public discourse and official policy are the distorting ideological prisms through which U.S. and Indian opinion-makers often view the relationship. Even today, much of the Indian strategic community can’t get past the old shibboleths of nonalignment—the idea, born in the Cold War, that India is best served by maximum distance from the United States. Among Western commentators, in turn, a focus on democratic values obfuscates the inexorable strategic logic driving Washington and New Delhi into each other’s arms. Together, the two countries’ public debates about each other generate a noise that drowns out the signals on changing Indo-U.S. relations.

All this confusion is on display this week, as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives to Washington for a summit meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday. As officials in the two capitals talk of Modi’s visit as a “milestone” in bilateral relations that will “consecrate” the U.S.-India strategic partnership, observers of the relationship are struggling once again. Modi’s Western critics wonder why Biden is hosting the Indian leader with such enthusiasm. After all, the Biden administration’s framing of geopolitics as a contest between democracy and autocracy implies opposition to what the critics consider Modi’s democratic backsliding. And in India, an old elite nostalgic for the era of nonalignment are once again surprised at Modi’s pursuit of close relations.

The problem is a reluctance to correctly read the trends driving the United States and India into a strategic embrace. The main source of their convergence is by now familiar: Both nations feel challenged by China. After much hesitation and reluctance over the last two decades, the United States has finally come around to the clear proposition that China represents a persistent, long-term threat to U.S. interests. The 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy affirmed that not even Russia’s war in Ukraine alters this strategic priority.

Washington’s and New Delhi’s new foreign-policy realism is likely to produce more surprises in the days ahead.

The United States has been drifting in this direction for quite some time. If Sino-U.S. bonhomie peaked in 2000 with then-U.S. President Bill Clinton’s visit to Beijing, his successors have all sought to recalibrate assumptions about Beijing’s benign rise. George W. Bush began his time in office with clear recognition of the need to counter China in Asia but was distracted by the 9/11 attacks and subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Barack Obama took the shift a step further, outlining a security “pivot to Asia,” but the presumed need to cooperate with China on economic and climate issues limited its implementation. Donald Trump’s 2017 National Security Strategy outlined the centrality of the Chinese challenge. Biden, in turn, doubled down on the China threat and articulated a more systematic U.S. response.

All presidents since Clinton signaled a strong desire for deeper strategic ties to India as part of the effort to restructure U.S. foreign and security policy toward Asia. Modi’s state visit to Washington this week is just the latest step in steadily growing U.S.-India relations, a process that has accelerated under Biden.

India, too, has zeroed in on China as its most important strategic challenge in the 21st century. Four significant military crises along the two countries’ common border in the Himalayas—in 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2020—have underlined the threat to New Delhi, as have Chinese policies that challenge India’s primacy in the subcontinent, Indian Ocean interests, and global aspirations.

Handwringing in the Indian political class prevented New Delhi from seizing the new opportunities with Washington under Bush, but Modi has now stepped forward to build a substantive strategic partnership. Put simply, the imperatives of a stronger U.S.-India partnership have been evident for more than two decades. The delay on the Indian side was about sorting out lingering suspicions about the United States. Today, Modi says there is “unprecedented trust” between the two nations’ leaders.

What has prevented analyst communities in both countries from fully recognizing the new direction in bilateral relations is the ideological discourse on foreign policy in each country: democracy and nonalignment, in the United States and India respectively.

The Western liberal critique of Modi’s domestic policies has tended to obfuscate the deepening structural convergence on China. The focus on global democracy promotion in official U.S. foreign policy since the Cold War never meant the United States would forego the pursuit of its many other interests. The hope of some—in both the United States and India—that the United States would somehow step in to save Indian democracy from itself was fanciful. Equally irrelevant were the fears of those in India—on both the left and right—who see U.S. conspiracies to meddle in India’s affairs everywhere.

The proposition that the United States, which can’t even manage to help next-door Haiti fix its democracy problems, can do something about democracy in faraway India was always an illusion. The battle to uphold democratic values in India is a political task for Indians and can’t be fought by liberals from abroad. What’s more, if Washington can do business for many decades with the House of Saud, the Pakistan Army, and the Chinese Communist Party, it is unreasonable to think it will be squeamish about building on clearly convergent interests with the Modi government.

Equally overdetermined is the role of nonalignment ideology in driving India’s foreign policy. After all, even in the depths of the Cold War, then-Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru turned to the United States for military support when China attacked in 1962. In Tibet in the 1950s, Nehru’s intelligence establishment collaborated with the CIA. Nehru’s successor, Indira Gandhi, only signed a security treaty with the Soviet Union in 1971, when she feared the implications of Sino-U.S. convergence in Asia initiated by the Nixon administration.

To be sure, democracy and nonalignment are part of the long-standing foreign-policy ideologies of the United States and India, and they are likely to remain an important part of each country’s domestic discourse. But neither ideology can be an end itself.

Washington has not allowed democratic values to come in the way of pursuing its security interests—the basis, one could argue, on which American democracy exists. The same holds for the Indian tradition of nonalignment: There is nothing to suggest that New Delhi is immune to the logic of dealing with the threats it confronts and the interests it must secure. Unlike his recent predecessors, Modi has the confidence to override lingering domestic skepticism and engage the United States for national benefit.

If the enormity of the China challenge to both countries has provided the structural impetus, strong political will in Washington and New Delhi is set to finalize a solid agenda. This ranges from defense and semiconductors to artificial intelligence and outer space. The new foreign-policy realism in Washington and New Delhi is thus very likely to produce some more surprises in the days ahead."

The Joe Biden’s administration rolled out its full pageantry for the Indian leader during the three-day visit. At a joint press conference with PM Modi, President Biden called this a new era in the US-India relationship. He exuded that the partnership is “stronger, closer and more dynamic than at any time in history” and that the economic relationship is “booming.”

The fact that trade between the two countries has more than doubled over the past decade underscores President Biden’s point. Despite all the pomp and pageantry of a state dinner and PM Modi’s address to the US Congress, it can be said that this visit wasn’t just about optics.

The two sides came to an agreement on a long list of deliverables spanning defence, critical and emerging technology, and space cooperation. The deals on defence and semiconductors in particular are aimed at countering China’s growing hegemony.

Let us take a look at all the deals and its impact on India’s status as an emerging power.

PM Modi’s US visit defence deals

General Electric (GE) has signed an agreement with India’s Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) to jointly manufacture engines, which will power fighter jets of the Indian Air Force. This historic deal is the most significant deliverable of PM Modi’s visit as the US is willing to give India access to cutting-edge jet engine technology, which it rarely shares. The GE engine in question is the F414, the workhorse for US Navy’s fighter jets.

The F414 engine will power India’s next-generation Tejas 2. India will also procure the deadly armed version of MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. These drones will significantly enhance India’s surveillance capabilities along the border with China in the Himalayan heights and in the Indian Ocean.

Boost to India’s domestic chip sector

India is looking to become a semiconductor powerhouse as US is encouraging American chipmakers to decrease their dependence on China. So, there were deals in this sphere as well.

US rchipmaker Micron Technology will invest more than $800 million towards a new $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and testing plant, to be built in Gujarat.

Applied Materials has announced that it will build a Semiconductor Centre for commercialisation and innovation in India in order to diversify its semiconductor supply chain.

PM Modi’s US visit: Big move on US visas

The Biden administration has announced that it will make it easier for skilled Indian workers to get and renew US visas. A pilot program to renew visas domestically for certain petition-based temporary workers will be introduced. This essentially means that applicants will not have to travel outside to get their renewal stamp. This program could be expanded to include H1B and L skilled visas by 2024.

India-US Space cooperation and Artemis Accords

India has joined the US-led Artemis Accords on space exploration. Also, India’s space agency ISRO will work with NASA towards a joint mission to the International Space Station in 2024.

Geopolitical messaging of PM Modi’s US visit

The US is trying to position India as a bulwark to China’s growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific. The Pentagon is also aiming to wean India off Russian arms. The deals that were signed during PM Modi’s US visit will enhance India’s role as a major player in the region and boost India's standing in the world."

While much progress has been made in the last few years, Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Washington is expected to give the relationship “escape velocity,” in the words of a U.S. National Security Council official and Indo-Pacific Coordinator. In boosting their bilateral cooperation amid a convergence of the two countries’ interests in Asia, the visit will focus on consolidating recent efforts to deepen ties in defense as well as the high-technology domain.

The last few weeks have seen intense consultations between the two sides and a series of high-profile visits to finalize the outcomes of the talks between Prime Minister Modi and President Joe Biden on June 22. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan visited Delhi earlier in June. India’s National Security Adviser, Ajit Doval, and Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra were in Washington in January and June of this year, respectively. A framework for cooperation in advanced technologies, a road map for defense industrial cooperation, and an agreement for expanding strategic trade are now in place. Modi and Biden have been pressing their respective bureaucracies to overcome the many regulatory obstacles to more productive collaboration in these areas. Agreements to facilitate the manufacture of jet engines for Indian fighter aircraft by General Electric and to promote cooperation in critical and emerging technologies are expected to figure prominently among the deliverables from Modi’s state visit to Washington.

India, which could not access U.S. weapons during the Cold War, has bought US$20 billion worth of arms over the last two decades. The armed forces in India and the United States engage in extensive bilateral military exercises and minilateral ones with the four partners in the Quad Forum — Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. The ambition is to look beyond arms purchases and facilitate the production of weapons in India through collaboration between defense firms in the two countries. The incentive for the United States is helping India reduce its historical dependence on Russia for its military supplies. For Delhi, it is about fulfilling Modi’s goal to turn India from the world’s largest importer of weapons into a major producer of weapons. Such collaboration will also help India bridge the massive gap in military capabilities with China with strong support from the United States. Both Delhi and Washington have a strong interest in stabilizing the Asian balance of power and coping with the geopolitical churn triggered by China’s rise and Beijing’s assertiveness in Asia."

NEW DELHI: On the final day of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s four-day state visit to the US, the two leaders put a spotlight on the “Innovation Handshake,"" a new initiative aimed at addressing regulatory hurdles that stand in the way of partnership between the two countries.

Modi’s visit concluded with enhanced economic ties, collaboration in manufacturing, and enhanced diplomatic presence.

He ended the trip with a triumphant speech to an auditorium of Indian-American business leaders. With Blinken sitting nearby, Modi recounted the trip's successes and highlighted ongoing agreements for India to purchase U.S.-made planes and helicopters.

President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Modi joined top American and Indian executives in talks to increase cooperation between the two countries on artificial intelligence, semiconductor production and space.

Mukesh Ambani, Anand Mahindra, Nikhil Kamath and Vrinda Kapoor were seen attending from India's side. American CEOs Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Thomas Tull and Astronaut Sunita Williams were spotted too.

""India and US are united by a common destiny. When our partnership progresses, the world will be a better place,’’ said PM Modi.

PM Modi underlined the immense potential of harnessing India-US tech cooperation for socio-economic growth.

He also applauded the contribution of India’s talented youth in fostering a culture of innovation. Biden called on CEOs to help expand India-US tech partnerships to new fields including biotechnology and quantum. Both leaders underscored that the India-US partnership would play an instrumental role in building a better future for our people and for the world.

PM Modi invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai to explore further avenues of collaboration in Artificial Intelligence, fintech, cybersecurity and mobile device manufacturing in India. He also discussed a possible collaboration between Google and academic institutions in India to promote research and development and skill development.

Meanwhile, while addressing a gathering of over 1000 professionals in the US at the John F. Kennedy Centre, PM highlighted the progress made in India.

""This is the moment,’’ he said and invited the professionals to forge partnerships with India.

While addressing the diaspora, in the Ronald Reagan Centre, PM Modi said that those attending the meeting have created a mini-India as there were representatives from across all states in India who are now settled in the US.

""In the past four days I have met President Biden, CEOs of leading companies and am impressed by the India-US partnership which is based on conviction, compassion and shared commitment for a better world,’’ said PM Modi to the diaspora adding that the foundation of the partnership was the Indian diaspora.

As part of Modi's state's visit — the first by an Indian leader since Manmohan Singh in 2009 — the two leaders announced several major investments by U.S.-based companies in India.

Micron Technology has agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending more than $800 million and India financing the rest. U.S.-based Applied Materials will launch a new semiconductor center for commercialization and innovation in India, and Lam Research, another semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will start a training program for 60,000 Indian engineers.

On the space front, India signed on to the Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space exploration cooperation among nations participating in NASA’s lunar exploration plans. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station next year.

Earlier this year, the two countries launched the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies, which sets the path for collaboration on semiconductor production, developing artificial intelligence, and a loosening of export control rules. The initiative was critical in sealing a deal, announced Thursday, that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India's Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines in India.

India has “proved that democracies can deliver and when I say deliver, this is regardless of class, creed, religion, gender,"" Modi declared.

Modi said the U.S. and India have been on “a long and beautiful journey” with unprecedented cooperation in defense and strategic areas as well as new trust in resolving longstanding trade issues.

He said the U.S.-India defense partnership had “reached new heights” during his visit, to the happiness of both sides.

“When I spoke to Congress about this, there was no stopping the applause in the chamber,” he said.

Both leaders underscored that the India-US partnership would play an instrumental role in building a better future for our people and for the world. PM Modi invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai to explore further avenues of collaboration in Artificial Intelligence, fintech, cybersecurity and mobile device manufacturing in India. He also discussed a possible collaboration between Google and academic institutions in India to promote research and development and skill development. Meanwhile, while addressing a gathering of over 1000 professionals in the US at the John F. Kennedy Centre, PM highlighted the progress made in India. ""This is the moment,’’ he said and invited the professionals to forge partnerships with India. While addressing the diaspora, in the Ronald Reagan Centre, PM Modi said that those attending the meeting have created a mini-India as there were representatives from across all states in India who are now settled in the US.

As part of Modi's state's visit — the first by an Indian leader since Manmohan Singh in 2009 — the two leaders announced several major investments by U.S.-based companies in India. Micron Technology has agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending more than $800 million and India financing the rest. U.S.-based Applied Materials will launch a new semiconductor center for commercialization and innovation in India, and Lam Research, another semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will start a training program for 60,000 Indian engineers. On the space front, India signed on to the Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space exploration cooperation among nations participating in NASA’s lunar exploration plans. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station next year. ALSO READ | The US has become one of India’s most important defence partners: PM Modi Earlier this year, the two countries launched the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies, which sets the path for collaboration on semiconductor production, developing artificial intelligence, and a loosening of export control rules. The initiative was critical in sealing a deal, announced Thursday, that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India's Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines in India. India has “proved that democracies can deliver and when I say deliver, this is regardless of class, creed, religion, gender,"" Modi declared. Modi said the U.S. and India have been on “a long and beautiful journey” with unprecedented cooperation in defense and strategic areas as well as new trust in resolving longstanding trade issues. He said the U.S.-India defense partnership had “reached new heights” during his visit, to the happiness of both sides. “When I spoke to Congress about this, there was no stopping the applause in the chamber,” he said.

288,https://www.wionews.com/india-news/narendra-modis-us-visit-a-watershed-moment-for-india-us-ties-605341,Narendra Modi's US Visit: A watershed moment for India-US ties,,"A momentous chapter in the history of these two great democracies. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepares for his highly anticipated four-day state visit to the United States on Monday, the world eagerly awaits the dawn of a new era of partnership between the world's oldest and largest democracies. Modi joins an exclusive group of leaders, including Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela who have twice addressed a joint meeting of the US Congress in the past.

This will be Modi's sixth overall visit to the US since taking over as PM in 2014. However, this visit is significant as he has been invited by President Joe Biden for his first state visit to the US. A state visit to the US is a coveted and unique honour, the US President accords to his closest friends and allies.

This visit is poised to witness the forging of significant deals, fostering bonhomie between leaders, and shaping the course of global geopolitics. With a shared commitment to democratic values, the US and India are set to deepen their cooperation across various sectors, from trade to technology and from security to climate change. The visit is set to bolster economic ties and strengthen diplomatic relations.

One of the key deals likely to be announced is the $1.8 billion deal for 18 Predator-B armed drones. These drones can long-range precision strikes and surveillance along borders and maritime areas. India and the US are also close to signing a military deal that would allow them to jointly develop fighter jet engines. Massachusetts-based aerospace manufacturing giant General Electric Co. (GE) will join hands with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. to produce the engines for the Tejas light-combat aircraft.

Watch this report: × On June 22, Modi will also address a joint session of the US Congress, becoming the sixth Indian Prime Minister to do so. While the Democrats and Republicans disagree on most of the issues, the two political rivals got together to send a bipartisan invite to Modi to address the joint meeting of Congress.

Modi's visit comes at a time when India and the US are facing multiple challenges as well as opportunities in a rapidly changing world. The two countries have forged a close strategic partnership over the years, based on shared values and interests. They have cooperated on various global issues, such as combating terrorism, promoting democracy and human rights, advancing clean energy and fighting COVID-19.

The visit will also bring into focus the growing people-to-people ties between the two countries, especially among the youth and diaspora. The US is home to over four million Indian Americans, who have made significant contributions to various sectors. Modi enjoys high popularity among them and has addressed several large gatherings of them during his previous visits.

The two countries have had a long cultural and intellectual exchange history since the late 19th century. One of the earliest examples was Swami Vivekananda's visit to America in 1893. As a young monk, he introduced Hinduism to the US at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago. He delivered a landmark speech celebrating toleration and universal acceptance of all religions.

Since then, many Indian leaders have visited the US and many American presidents have visited India. Some of these visits have been memorable for their impact on bilateral relations and global affairs.

- India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's visit to Washington in 1949 marked the beginning of diplomatic ties between independent India and the US. -Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. visited India in 1959 for a month-long tour. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violent struggle for national independence, King said said 'Non-violence is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity.'

- Dwight Eisenhower's visit to New Delhi in 1959 was the first by a US president to India and boosted cooperation on agriculture and development. He also addressed the Indian parliament. - John F. Kennedy's meeting with Indira Gandhi in Washington in 1961 laid the foundation for a strategic partnership on defence and security.

- Richard Nixon's visit to New Delhi in 1969 was marred by protests over his support for Pakistan during the Bangladesh conflict.

- Indira Gandhi's visit to Washington in 1982 revived ties after a period of estrangement due to India's nuclear test in 1974. -In 1978 U.S. President Jimmy Carter visited India on a three-day official trip. He visited a Gurugram village, Daulatpur Nasirabad, which was renamed Carterpuri.

- Bill Clinton's visit to India in 2000 was hailed as a watershed moment for transforming relations into a 'natural alliance'. - Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to Washington in 2000 declared that India and the US were 'natural allies' and signed a landmark civil nuclear deal. -In 2006 President George Bush visited India, where he and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh finalised the framework of the civil nuclear deal, boosting security and economic ties. -In 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama hosted the inaugural state visit of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. A visit which highlighted the growing bonhomie between New Delhi & Washington.

- A year later, Barack Obama's visit to India was historic as he became the first US president to attend the Republic Day parade as chief guest. These visits have shaped the India-US ties over the past seven decades and have reflected their changing priorities and challenges. Modi's visit in 2023 will be another landmark in this journey and will pave the way for a stronger and deeper partnership between the two countries. Prime Minister Modi will also interact with CEOs of leading American companies including FedEx, MasterCard and Adobe.

It will follow the official state dinner on June 22 at the White House with President Joe Biden - a celebration billed as a milestone in relations between the two democracies.

Indian Americans have also made their mark in politics, with several holding high positions in federal, state, and local governments. The most prominent example is Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the first person of Indian origin to hold such a post. Other notable Indian Americans include Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah, Congressman Ami Bera, Senator Raja Krishnamoorthi, Governor Nikki Haley, and Mayor Ravi Bhalla, among others.

Indian Americans have also been influential in shaping public opinion and discourse on various issues. They have been active in media, academia, think tanks, civil society organisations, and advocacy groups. They have also been vocal supporters of India-US relations and have played a bridging role between the two countries.

289,https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/06/modis-trip-washington-marks-new-heights-us-india-ties,Modi’s Trip to Washington Marks New Heights in U.S.-India Ties,,"Against the backdrop of tightening U.S.-India ties, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to Washington this week for an official state visit — only the third President Joe Biden has hosted since taking office. The bilateral relationship has soared to new heights in recent years, particularly on economic, technological and defense issues. Underpinning these developments is both sides’ desire to counter China’s effort to project power and influence across the Indo-Pacific region. While Washington and New Delhi have their disagreements on issues like Russia’s war on Ukraine and human rights, they see the relationship as too strategically vital to be jeopardized by these differences.

USIP’s Tamanna Salikuddin, Vikram Singh, Sameer Lalwani and Daniel Markey analyze the significance of this visit, the difficult issues that will be on the table, and how China will factor will into the leaders’ discussions.

What is the significance of the state visit for both the United States and for India?

Salikuddin: Modi’s visit will be filled with substantive and ceremonial events, including a South Lawn welcome, a state dinner and an address to a joint session of Congress. While Modi has visited the United States several times, this will be his first state visit, demonstrating the depth of the bilateral U.S.-India relationship, which Biden has described as the “defining relationship” of the 21st century. Per the White House’s official announcement, “the visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space.”

While none of the official statements mention China, this visit is all about China. As U.S.-China competition is only becoming more intense and the Biden administration identifies China as its “pacing” challenge, India is one of the most important partners for the United States in its Indo-Pacific policy. While India actively counters China on its northern border, its deepening relationship with the United States make it part of the bulwark of nations committed to countering Beijing’s malign influence.

Beyond the convergence on China, India and the United States are seeking deeper ties on economic, defense and technological grounds. This visit is significant in cementing the partnership, and no detail is being left unchecked with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan visiting New Delhi in the last few weeks. This visit and the broader high-level U.S.-India engagements this year — including Biden’s planned trip to New Delhi in the fall — are a high-water mark in the bilateral relationship. Coming 18 years after the historic U.S.-India civil nuclear deal, these engagements highlight the remarkable progress that has been made in terms of expanding economic, social, technological and defense aspects of the U.S.-India relationship.

As Modi departed India, he reaffirmed the significance of the trip: “I am confident that my visit to the [U.S.] will reinforce our ties based on shared values of democracy, diversity, and freedom. Together we stand stronger in meeting the shared global challenges.”

What are the difficult topics that might be on the table, and how are Biden and Modi likely to navigate these?

Singh: Biden and Modi are determined to take U.S.-India relations to a new level with this visit, and part of having a mature strategic partnership is the ability to tackle difficult issues and areas of disagreement.

Issues that get a lot of media attention include policy differences on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and issues of human rights and democracy. More below-the-radar are key regional challenges like Afghanistan and Myanmar; enduring difficulties in a bilateral trade agenda; and finding a way to cooperate more on global governance, especially regulation of technology and the digital economy.

India will also seek progress in easing visas for Indian citizens, especially student visas and H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers, and U.S. commitments to greater technology sharing needed to implement the high-tech cooperation the leaders have rolled out.

A major change over the past decade is that the United States and India can now disagree on some issues and continue to work together on a large shared agenda. Given the strong personal bond Biden and Modi seem to have developed, expect them to be direct and forthright with one another in private and broadly supportive and celebratory in public.

On issues like Ukraine, intense private consultations will likely touch on assessments of the state of the conflict and the need to ensure Putin does not turn to nuclear weapons. Biden may seek Modi’s assessment of Putin and possible paths Russia might take to end the war. On Afghanistan, Modi and Biden may share assessments of Taliban, al-Qaida, ISIS and Pakistan-based militant threats since the U.S. withdrawal. India has kept a small diplomatic presence in Afghanistan and may encourage the United States to engage more actively to partner in preventing terrorism in and from the region.

Democracy and human rights, which get the most media attention, will not be avoided, but expect a similar pragmatic approach. U.S. leaders are concerned about democracy everywhere — including at home. Biden has taken an inclusive view that all democracies face challenges and that leaders of democracies should work together to improve durable democratic development. That will likely be the approach with India. U.S. leaders will welcome public comments or gestures from Modi in support of pluralistic democracy, but do not believe that lecturing India on these issues can be effective. A logical takeaway is that the United States will handle human rights concerns with India more like it does with a country like Poland.

First and foremost, Biden and Modi both pursue the interests of their own citizens, and they seem to understand each other on this basis. For Modi, this means development and meeting the basic needs of 1.4 billion people by transforming India into a modern, global technology powerhouse that competes with China. For Biden it means rebuilding the American middle class and maintaining America’s global leadership. Underneath the lofty rhetoric about two great democracies, these leaders see pragmatic benefits for their own people coming from deeper social, economic, political and security ties. They will manage the hard stuff to protect those gains.

How might the outcomes of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s recent trip to India shape conversations on defense and technology?

Lalwani: Austin’s trip to New Delhi two weeks ago helped finalize agreements and set the table for Modi’s historic state visit to Washington. The 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy called for more technology cooperation with allies and partners, which produced greater technology-sharing mechanisms with Australia (through the AUKUS deal with the United Kingdom) as well as with Japan. Now the United States appears poised to take some unprecedented steps toward the third partner in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, India.

U.S. technology cooperation with India is likely to include co-production and technology sharing of General Electric engines, which will be used in Indian military fighter jets to deter and defend against China. Additional Defense Department efforts involve a defense industrial cooperation roadmap to expedite co-production of military equipment; new programs to network both countries entrepreneurs, research labs, industry, and venture capital fueling defense innovations over the medium term; and enhanced scientific collaboration on emerging technologies in artificial intelligence, synthetic biology and robotics.

The strategic result will be twofold — enhanced Indian deterrence and greater trust in U.S.-India defense collaboration. First, in the near to medium term, India will be able to augment its military capabilities to defend against Chinese aggression, which ratcheted up with the Galwan crisis and clashes during the summer of 2020. The defense industrial roadmap involves four focus areas for fast-tracking technology cooperation: air combat and land mobility systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR); munitions; and the undersea domain awareness (UDA).

As India is able to quickly develop better ISR assets, it will be able to identify the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) maneuvers or gray zone incursions on their disputed continental border much earlier. Similarly, better UDA will enable India to better discern and track Chinese submarine activity in the Indian Ocean, and share that data with friends and partners. With both, detection will play a critical role in deterrence. Greater land mobility systems will help India to quickly surge forces and supplies to flashpoints along the disputed border with China, while longer range munitions can threaten to interdict PLA supply lines in the event of a conflict.

The second expected result of this technology sharing effort can be greater mutual trust in order to enhance collaboration in the Indo-Pacific. The trust generated from top-down and bottom-up technology cooperation may be less tangible yet is more significant. India has made no secret of its decades-long desire for a high-technology partnership, and the great lengths the U.S. government has gone to fulfill this deserve serves as a costly signal of its commitment and reliability. With this mutual trust, both partners will be better able to engage in more advanced joint assessments, contingency planning, and exercises as they prepare to backstop each other, interoperate together, and share the burdens of deterring aggression and securing the Indo-Pacific commons.

What are the most pressing issues the United States and India will be focused on when it comes to China?

Markey: The bedrock for cooperation between the United States and India lies in a shared interest in deterring Chinese territorial aggression and challenging the extension of China’s political influence and military presence in India’s backyard.

The most immediate concern is along the Line of Actual Control, the contested China-India land border, where China has made vast investments in military infrastructure that have already enabled it to push India from former patrolling points and could, in a worst-case scenario, even enable large-scale incursions into Indian territory. U.S. officials are eager to help India reinforce its own capacity to deter and defend against such attacks, as they pose a genuine near-term threat to Indian security and represent a dangerous precedent that could intimidate other less powerful states across the Indo-Pacific region. U.S. defense sales to India are intended to fill immediate capability gaps (for instance, to improve border surveillance with U.S.-made drones) as well as to co-manufacture future weapon systems (such as fighter jet engines).

Also of concern to both Washington and New Delhi is the rapid growth of China’s navy. Although China’s military is disproportionately focused on challenges along the nation’s eastern seaboard, especially Taiwan and the South and East China Seas, the rapid modernization and expansion of its fleet enables operations across the Indian Ocean as well. U.S. officials aim to explore cooperative ventures with India that will enable better monitoring of and response to Chinese maritime activities.

Finally, whereas in the past Indian officials jealously perceived U.S. involvement in South Asia as a threat to India’s regional hegemony, now New Delhi is increasingly eager to see Washington play an active economic and political role in neighboring states across the region, such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, as a means to counterbalance Chinese influence."

291,https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/modi-2-0-and-the-india-us-partnership-what-next/,Modi 2.0 and the India-US Partnership: What Next?,,"As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after winning a second term, sets his eyes to confront major foreign policy challenges, India-U.S. relations stand at an inflection point. In the strategic context, India-U.S. ties are well-positioned for Modi 2.0 to move further forward. However, New Delhi and Washington seem destined to encounter a number of roadblocks in the economic sector, at least in the near future.

A number of high-level meetings are on the schedule, including a planned meeting between Modi and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the upcoming G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan and an upcoming visit by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to India. Therefore, it is imperative to reflect on the highs and lows of India-U.S. relations, and the way forward in this strategic partnership.

Where do India-U.S. relations figure on India’s foreign policy radar as New Delhi seeks to leverage its relationships with all the major powers? The United States remains perhaps the most consequential partner in India’s Indo-Pacific strategy and several U.S. government documents, including the latest U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy released by the Department of Defense, laud the convergence of interests and values between the two countries to engineer a “free, open, inclusive and rules-based” Indo-Pacific. Defense engagement has been and is an important pillar of India-U.S. cooperation. Modi’s Make in India campaign finds resonance with America’s quest for a major source of export for its defense industries. The India-U.S. Indo-Pacific partnership has further provided impetus to augment cooperation in the maritime domain. The scope and regularity of interoperability exercises between the militaries of the two countries has been on an upward trend.

On a recent visit to the United States, Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said the “India-U.S. relationship has really flourished since Modi took power.” However, as India and the United States attempt to chart new territories in their relationship, economic issues are primed to play spoilsport.

Interestingly, it was India’s economic opening in the post-Cold War era that caught the attention of the U.S. Commerce Department, which dubbed India one of the Big Emerging Markets (BEMs). According to the latest data provided by the Office of the United States Trade Representative, U.S.-India trade in goods was merely $87.5 billion and trade in services was at $54.6 billion in 2018. Despite all the high expectations of taking bilateral trade closer to $500 billion, a tit-for-tat tariff spat between the two countries is catching all the attention.

Trade related differences between India and the United States are not new, but the transactional nature of the Trump administration approach to these issues has injected bitterness into the relationship. Trump called India the “tariff king” and also announced withdrawal of the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) from India, which will amount to losses of $190 million on the total $5.6 billion in trade under the GSP. India’s Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal reportedly brushed aside the impact of GSP withdrawal, saying India accepted it “gracefully” and would rather work toward making Indian exports more competitive. Nevertheless, New Delhi has taken a reciprocal move by deciding to impose long-pending retaliatory tariffs on a number of U.S. products.

Concerns abound that India, following China, could perhaps become the next target for Section 301 investigations under the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which allows U.S. administrations to take actions, including imposing tariffs, against other countries whose actions are deemed to restrict U.S. commerce. Modi, speaking at the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in an apparent rebuke to the Trump administration’s trade related steps, criticized unilateralism and trade protectionism and propagated the need for a rules-based, anti-discriminatory, and all-inclusive WTO-centered multilateral trading system. Pompeo, who will be visiting India soon, while speaking at the India Ideas Summit of the U.S.-India Business Council said, “We remain open to dialogue, and hope that our friends in India will drop their trade barriers and trust in the competitiveness of their own companies, their own businesses, their own people, and private sector companies.”

Meanwhile, the U.S. decision to sanction countries like Iran and Russia under the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), has often made it difficult for India to maneuver its ties with a primary defense supplier like Russia and a primary energy supplier like Iran. Alice Wells, head of the State Department’s South and Central Asia Bureau, speaking at a congressional hearing, warned that India’s decision to buy the Russian-made S-400 Triumf missile defense system could “limit” growing interoperability between the U.S. and Indian militaries. In an apparent attempt to dilute further India-Russia defense trade, the United States has reportedly offered high-end defense equipment such as the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS II), the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Patriot Advance Capability (PAC-3), and the fifth-generation F-35 fighter jet.

India’s former Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran recently wrote, “We will have to actively seek partnerships which are more issue based and hold the promise of advancing India’s economic and security interests. In this sense, some partnerships will be more valued than others but need not be exclusive.”

As such, ahead of Pompeo’s visit and the Modi-Trump meeting at the G-20, the task is set out for India’s foreign policy mandarins. New Delhi is required to balance its relations deftly, at a time of rising U.S.-China confrontation and Trump’s apparent intent to increase economic pressure on partners like India, despite broader strategic convergence. It is high time for the leadership and the diplomatic machineries on both sides to sit down and seriously negotiate. The India-U.S. partnership is at a critical juncture. While India and the United States both call for a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific, targeting China’s intransigence over security matters, India joins China and Russia to call out the United States’ unilateral trade protectionism. India’s great power relations are at a turning point where New Delhi has to adroitly manage its security and economic interests. How India creates space for the protection and promotion of its national interest in this complex and fluid environment will remain a prominent foreign policy question as Modi steps into his second term.

292,https://thewire.in/security/modi-us-visit-security-vulnerability,Modi’s US Visit Has Increased India’s Vulnerabilities,,"Geopolitical rivalry with China has brought India and the US into the tight strategic embrace which was on ample display during the recent state visit to Washington of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The US needs India for global geopolitics while India wants the US for regional geopolitics.

The only problem is that the US, having identified China as its sole geopolitical competitor in this century – with the capability to match it in economy, technology, diplomacy, and military – has failed to accept that its deterrence (military power) model of the Cold War is unsuitable against the Chinese geopolitical model, which is based more on global cooperation for prosperity than military power alone.

Even in a fragmented world, the Chinese model cannot fail. Changing the game from free trade to weaponised trade by ‘decoupling’ or ‘de-risking’ value chains and supply chain networks from dependence on China – still the world’s biggest trading partner – will only add to geopolitical tensions with the global economy heading towards recession.

Unmindful of the disastrous fall-out of the Ukraine war on the global economic order led by the US dollar, the reluctance of its regional allies to openly confront China and the own recent experience of its top diplomat being lectured by Chinese supremo Xi Jinping, the US has decided to bet on India to build it as a military bulwark against China in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

The long-term bet is based on the assumption that Prime Minister Modi will win the 2024 general elections and will not normalise India’s relations with China in this decade — the time it would take for deliverables promised by each side to take shape. The other assumption is that, if push comes to shove, India, as claimed by its political and military leadership, will be able to take on the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in a border war.

Ironically, the huge jubilation in India regarding the Modi visit missed the point that under the new transactional arrangement, India would end up giving far more, including its strategic autonomy, than it will get in return – which will be further accentuated by the US’s irrepressible urge (as seen during the 2005-2008 civil nuclear deal negotiations) to shift the goalposts.

The US agenda

So, what does the US want from India?

It wants commonality of military equipment by slowly weaning India (the largest arms importer in the world) away from Russia, its traditional, affordable, and trusted partner. It wants to improve Indian naval dockyards to serve as temporary military bases for its assets (vessels of all hue, including nuclear submarines and carriers) in the IOR. It also wants the Indian military (especially the navy) to do advanced exercises bilaterally and multi-laterally with the Quad navies for developing interoperability for combat in the IOR, which India considers its backwaters. Since the character of war has changed with new-age technologies, the US wants to pull up the technological level of the Indian military through the newly crafted India-United States Defence Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X), which is part of the bigger Innovation on Critical and Emerging Technologies (ICET) framework whereby it will be able to operate within the US Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) defence network under its ‘integrated deterrence’ strategy by the end of this decade.

All this has become possible as India (which is neither a military ally nor a non-NATO ally) has signed the US military’s four foundational agreements which qualify it to be part of the US’s new age networks. Thus, by 2030, India will fulfil all the requirements for interoperability: commonality of equipment, advanced military exercises, combat support facilities like MROs (maintenance, repair, operations) from the US, and familiarity with various war contingencies in the IOR.

Moreover, as part of iCET, India will adopt US rules, regulatory, norms, and standards in the new age fourth industrial technologies for trade and commerce since US companies will have first user advantage in India. Thus, given the certainty of the splinternet (bifurcation of the Internet and the value supply chains) based on US and Chinese technologies, India will get strategically isolated from its South Asian neighbours, all of which are onboard the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative), which will be based on the Chinese internet by 2030.

GE engines and technology transfer

Let’s now examine the deals individually, starting with General Electric’s memorandum of understanding with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).

According to the GE press release, it will deliver 99 F-414 engines for Indian Air Force (IAF) Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mk2 programme. GE will also help with the ‘prototype development, testing, and certification of the AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft) programme with its F-414-INS6 engine’. Moreover, GE will provide 99 F-404 engines for the LCA Mk1 programme. Both GE engines (F-404 and F-414) have already been part of the development of LCA Mk1 and LCA Mk2 programmes.

Three observations are in order. One, there will be no transfer of technology (ToT) of turbofan and casting technologies and even metallurgy formulae which make up almost 95 per cent of the engine’s Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs). It stands to logic that GE, which has spent huge amounts of time, resources, and talent creating the engine, cannot hand over its IPRs to India and create a competitor for itself. All India will get is engine assembly rights (called indigenous production in India), like we have for Russian AL-31FP engines for the Su-30MKI, which are being made in Koraput since 2004. The remaining five per cent ToT which includes tools for engine maintenance may be allowed by GE after the US Congress clears it. Thus, the IAF will be saddled with the burden of maintaining yet another engine besides British, Russian, and French.

Two, the US will make a strong bid for the IAF’s urgent operational need of 114 fighter jets under the Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) and the Indian Navy’s carrier-borne fighter programmes, in both of which Boeing’s Super Hornet, powered by GE-F414 engines, is a contender. Cheaper than the Rafale, the Super Hornet has been in US military service since 1999 with various upgrades. The IAF will be saddled with one more fighter, when it wants to reduce its types of combat aircraft. The Super Hornet, if it comes to the IAF and the Indian Navy, will be Prime Minister Modi’s choice rather than the Services’ Headquarters, which favours Rafale.

Three, while care will be taken by the Indian side to make an impregnable legal case against US sanctions on GE F-414, the US is not known to care much for legalities. A case in point is the freedom of navigation patrols by US Navy vessels in the South China Sea (SCS) and Taiwan Strait citing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) when the US has not even ratified the universal convention.

Why drones are no big deal

Regarding drones, India has agreed to buy 31 General Atomics (GA) MQ-9B (Sea Guardian and Sky Guardian) armed and unarmed drones under Foreign Military Sales (FMS) for the price of approximately US$3 billion. The offset amount of this deal will be used by GA to establish an MRO facility in India. These drones (also called Predators and Reapers) are extremely expensive, slow-moving, and completely out of sync with present and future trends in warfare. On the positive side, these drones carry big payloads, and have good range and mission capability since they are equipped with electro-optic video cameras, laser designators, good communication relay with ground stations, good electromagnetic systems, and signal intelligent equipment. They also have endurance of 40 hours. On the downside, with slow speed they are vulnerable and can be shot down by enemy air defence systems. Moreover, they lack autonomy (AI), are not stealthy and, most of all, require a lot of people on the ground to operate them.

In his book Army of None, US analyst Paul Scharre writes, ‘Predator and Reaper drone operations require seven to ten pilots to staff one drone orbit of 24/7 continuous around-the-clock coverage over an area. Another 20 people per orbit are required to operate the sensors on the drone, and scores of intelligence analysts are needed to sift through the sensor data. In fact, because of these substantial personnel requirements, the US Air Force has a strong resistance to calling these aircraft unmanned.’

The irony is that when these UAVs had a lucrative market in the early 2000s, US laws did not allow their sale. Now, when the US has approved their export, many more cost-effective and better-performing drones with AI options are available. Incidentally, China is a leading exporter of military drones. There can only be two reasons for India buying these outdated and expensive drones: US pressure and the Indian military’s tendency to conflate capability with sophisticated weapon platforms.

What iCET and INDUS-X really represent

The US pressure for this purchase is for its Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) under the Indo-Pacific partnership which was announced in Tokyo in 2022. Under this, the Quad members are to do data collection and sharing of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) feeds with partners in Southeast Asia and Pacific nations. India, given its location, has a special responsibility which is evident from two things: It is the only country which has operational interaction with three US theatre commands namely, INDOPACOM, Central Command, and Africa Command. And the Indian Navy’s Gurgaon-based Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC), whose software has been supplied by US companies CISCO and Raytheon, will be the nerve centre of the MDA project. To keep data cyber-secure, new undersea cables will be laid connecting all Quad members.

To understand the iCET framework and the INDUS-X scheme – which have been touted as the biggest US offering to India since the civil-nuclear deal – it is essential to first understand the context. Following the 2012 discovery of Deep Learning which revolutionised AI, and conscious that most emerging technologies including AI were being incubated in the commercial sector, the Pentagon in 2015 opened its outpost called Defence Innovation Unit (DIU) in Silicon Valley. Staffed with mostly civilian software experts and a few retired and active-duty military officers, the DIU was to help identify advanced commercial technologies for military use.

Taking a cue from the Pentagon’s DIU, the Indian defence ministry, in April 2018, launched the Innovation for Defence Excellence (iDEX) scheme under the defence secretary for incubation of new age technologies development in defence and aerospace from within the industry, start-ups, civilian laboratories, academia and so on. Unfortunately, iDEX has not delivered for four reasons: it is headed by bureaucrats with little domain knowledge, many start-ups that get good funding are owned by former military officers with questionable links in the system, deserving start-ups with few resources are bought by the Defence Research and Development Organisation, and projects are time-bound, which stymies creativity, ideas, and innovations.

Worse, there is little clarity on new-age commercial technologies prioritisation and how to harness them for military use. For instance, there are 20 advanced commercial technologies to choose from for military use. These are AI (where all new age technologies converge), 5G wireless and advanced networking, sensors with edge computing, Internet of Things, biotechnology, robotics and autonomy, semiconductors, blockchain, virtual reality (for simulation), metaverse, star-link internet, natural languages processing, space, cyber, advanced manufacturing, energy storage technologies, quantum computing, brain-computer interface, genomics, and exoskeletons.

Meanwhile, aware that talent is the most important pillar of AI alongside data, hardware (microelectronics), and software (algorithms), and with many talented Chinese AI researchers leaving the US for China following the tech war, the US, which attracts talent from across the world (mostly Chinese and Indians) to remain the global innovation hub, seemed to be losing the competition for talent to China.

Against this backdrop, the Indian and US National Security Advisors met in January 2023 to launch the ICET framework to be the bridge between commercial and defence sectors. Under the ICET, the two sides launched the INDUS-X scheme chaired jointly by the Pentagon and India’s iDEX to identify Indian defence start-ups which will work with the US start-ups organised by the civilian US-India Business Council (USIBC) to design, prototype, test, and produce commercial technologies with application in ‘integrated deterrence’ network. While in theory, the money for identified start-ups will come from a joint development fund, in practice they will be funded by the Pentagon. This way, the US military will be able to match, if not beat, the PLA’s 2035 deadline of robotic war (called intelligentised war) and make up for its talent shortage using Indian researchers to meet the Chinese challenge of becoming the world’s primary AI innovation centre by 2030.

It is for this reason that the US is easing H1B and L1 visas procedures for Indian STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) graduates and research scholars to work in the US. This is a good thing for Indian scholars and start-ups who will gain knowledge by working in world-class innovation hubs. Of course, it would have been better if the Indian civilian start-ups could work directly with the DIU (instead of through the iDEX and the Pentagon) for the understanding of all advanced commercial technologies.

However, for India which prided itself on its strategic autonomy in foreign policy, allowing Indian shipyards to emerge ‘as a hub for maintenance and repair of forward deployed (in the IOR) US navy assets (navy ships and naval fighters)’ is too big a price to pay for Modi’s rousing welcome in the US. Taking forward the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Understanding (LEMOA) signed by the Modi government in 2016, which allowed re-fuelling and other turn-around facilities to the US naval assets on a case-to-case basis, the present arrangement will permit the US to upgrade Indian shipyards to berth US warships for long periods. Shorn of rhetoric, India has agreed to provide military basing to the US military.

The impact on China

The big question now is: How will China assess India’s tight embrace of the US? China will conclude that normalisation of relations with the Modi government will not be possible since India has sacrificed its strategic autonomy to accommodate US military interests in the IOR.

Worse, India has become the US’s first line of offence against Chinese interests and infrastructure in the South Asian region (by denouncing its Belt and Road Initiative as a debt trap). Moreover, in cahoots with the US, India will be seen to threaten China’s commerce and trade worth over US$4 trillion annually which passes through the 3,000 nautical miles IOR from the Strait of Hormuz to the Strait of Malacca. This, at a time when the Chinese deterrence in the IOR is a decade away.

Xi Jinping’s directive to the PLA was to prepare capabilities (deterrence) to meet the (US) challenge in West Pacific and the Indian border by 2027, and across Asia Pacific (including IOR) by 2035. The PLA has already achieved deterrence (and capabilities to fight if deterrence failed) ahead of its timeline in the West Pacific and is working on the entire region.

China’s deterrence in the West Pacific where it faces challenges in the Taiwan Strait and the South and East China Sea is based on the combination of its military power and economic power (its intense trade with ASEAN and US allies like Japan and South Korea). Given the advantage of its geography, and the formidable Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) firewall that the PLA has created against the US, China refused Antony Blinken’s request in Beijing for opening bilateral military communication to avert a crisis in the region. While the stated reason by China for doing this are the US sanctions on its defence minister, Gen. Li Shangfu, the actual reason is to discourage US freedom of navigation and air patrols in the waters and air space in the Chinese backyard. Much in line with the US’s Monroe Doctrine – which disallows the presence of outside powers in the Western hemisphere – China wants US military activities in West Pacific to end.

Meanwhile, aware of its eroded deterrence in the West Pacific, the US military is reinforcing its regional alliances, seeking a global role for NATO and strengthening its military bases in Hawaii and Guam.

Chinese deterrence outside the West Pacific will be based on its economic deterrence anchored on BRICS and BRI, and its military deterrence anchored on the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and cooperative security with nations onboard the BRI. Since prosperity is at the vanguard of the BRI, Xi Jinping has announced that the third BRI Forum will be held in Beijing this year. The actual dates of the Forum perhaps await progress on Xi’s pet project of ‘Xiongan (meaning brave and peaceful) New Area’, 100km outside Beijing which is being called the vice-capital of China. Named the ‘plan of a thousand years’ by Xi, this city, meant to de-congest Beijing by moving many governments, financial, medical, academic, and military headquarters here, is being built with cyberspace software connectivity (part of the Digital Silk Road, a sub-set of the BRI) using industrial internet technologies like blockchain, 5G, IoT, big data and so on. This smart city will become the blockchain hub in China with blockchain-based services. Given this, it will be a good idea for Xi to showcase this smart city close to Beijing to the Forum delegates for them to get a sense of how the new phase of BRI (cyberspace software connectivity) which will likely figure in Xi’s address, would usher in prosperity by industrial internet.

China’s economic deterrence for BRI nations will get delayed owing to the chip war with the US. For example, China has been denied advanced chips which are required in AI and data centres for computing, storage, and for servers. Slowing economic deterrence will affect military deterrence which is based on cooperative security (PLA working with host BRI nation’s security forces for the protection of Chinese infrastructure, interests, and people).

Given the likelihood of China’s military deterrence lagging behind the US – which is supported now by India in South Asia and the IOR – Beijing might decide to up the ante on its border. Since China sees the boundary problem with India as a dispute regarding its sovereignty, it may decide to upend the US’s growing integrated deterrence in the region by a short and decisive war with India. In that sense, Modi’s US embrace has increased India’s vulnerabilities.

Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said that the Indo-U.S. relationship has come a ""long way.""

""You can look at the technology part of the relationship, you can look at the trade in the relationship, you can look at the political convergence, and you can look at the strategic interests. So, I think there is a very compelling case for stronger and stronger India-U.S. relations,"" Jaishankar told reporters last week.

The most compelling case, analysts say, is the rise of China. Modi visits the United States as India’s fraying ties with Beijing following a three-year-long military standoff along their disputed Himalayan borders have prompted New Delhi to drop previous hesitations and work closely with Washington in Asia as it seeks to counterbalance an increasingly assertive Beijing.

""The strategic landscape in the Indo-Pacific has changed very dramatically and there is recognition both in Washington and New Delhi that they need to work ever so closely to stabilize the situation,"" said Harsh Pant, vice president, studies and foreign policy, at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.

""That strategic clarity has meant that for India strengthening ties with a like-minded country like the U.S. has become a strategic imperative,"" he said.

Giving India access to advanced defense technologies, including coproduction of weapons, is expected to be a key takeaway during Modi’s visit. This could include an agreement to produce jet engines by General Electric for military aircraft in India according to a Reuters report. The two countries are also discussing the possible purchase of U.S.-made armed drones by India.

Analysts say the defense partnership is being shored up as Washington wants to build India’s military capabilities.

""The Americans are looking to strengthen India as a counterweight to China, so they want to support India’s military modernization,"" according to Sreeram Chaulia, dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs. ""That is why both sides have removed some of the cobwebs that existed and are saying we have the same adversary, and we need to cooperate a lot more to push back this shared adversary.""

He said that from India’s standpoint also there are question marks over the viability of Russia as a military supplier, which for decades provided the bulk of Indian military hardware, to provide India with advanced weapons as it is weakened by Western sanctions.

The groundwork for Modi’s visit has been laid by recent high-level visits by U.S. officials to India. Earlier this month, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the two countries are setting a roadmap for defense industrial cooperation.

Modi is also expected to meet top business leaders in Washington as he tries to woo American companies amid U.S. efforts to diversify supply chains beyond China in critical areas such as semiconductors.

Building factories in India however has not been easy with U.S. businesses often complaining of regulatory and bureaucratic hurdles.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, on a visit to New Delhi, told an Indian business forum Tuesday that both countries are engaged in efforts to facilitate trade.

""A number of the deliverables at that [Modi] visit are not just bullet points on a page. They are fundamentally designed to remove those obstacles in defense trade, in high-tech trade, in investment in each of our countries in taking away obstacles,"" according to Sullivan.

The areas in which the two countries aim to deepen cooperation include quantum computing, artificial intelligence and 5G wireless networks — areas in which China has acquired a dominating position.

The visit will include all the pomp and ceremony that accompanies state visits – the last state visit by an Indian prime minister to Washington took place in 2009. Modi will also address a joint session of the U.S. Congress – the second time he will be doing it since he took power nine years ago.

In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, addressing the U.S.-India Business Council on Monday, expressed optimism about the visit.

""So, we are here almost literally on the eve of what we believe will be a historic state visit by Prime Minister Modi, one that will further solidify what President Biden has called the defining relationship of the 21st century.""

However, amid shifting geopolitics, the two countries are not always on the same page. India has strongly defended maintaining friendly ties with Russia in the aftermath of its Ukraine aggression. In recent months, Moscow has become New Delhi’s biggest crude oil supplier as India snaps up supplies of cheap energy.

Critics have also expressed concerns about democratic backsliding in India, accusing the Modi administration of stifling dissent and divisive policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities. In its latest annual report on human rights practices, the U.S. State Department also highlighted challenges to freedom of expression and violence targeting religious and ethnic minorities in India. New Delhi rejected the report calling it flawed and biased.

But analysts say the effort by both countries during Modi’s visit will be to build on common interests while managing their differences as the two countries focus on the big picture of countering China.

""When the Ukraine war started there was a lot of concern that it will derail the relationship and the two countries are going in different directions,"" Pant said.

""But the relationship has continued to grow, it fact it has become more vibrant. I think that is because there is a new recognition that with all the challenges that India faces, it is a good bet and Washington needs to cultivate India,"" he said."

Modi’s visit to the US prompted a mixed reaction from South Asian Americans and human rights groups, some of whom protested the prime minister’s visit due to his human rights record in India.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to the United States to meet with President Joe Biden and address the Congress, with military and technological ties on the agenda as his hosts seek a regional counter to China.

“We seek to deepen India-USA ties in key sectors like trade, commerce, innovation, technology and other such areas,” Modi posted on Twitter before he left on Tuesday for his first state visit to the US since assuming power in 2014.

The leader of the world’s most populous nation will attend a state dinner at the White House on Thursday – only Biden’s third since his inauguration.

Hailed by New Delhi as an “historic” chance to “expand and consolidate” ties, the visit comes at a time of rising concerns over the treatment of its Muslim minority, human rights, and democratic backsliding under the Hindu nationalist leader.

But Biden has made clear he sees US ties to India as a defining relationship that will jointly address some of the most difficult global challenges in coming years, including climate change, disruptions related to artificial intelligence, and China’s growing power in the Indo-Pacific.

Visit amid rights concerns

Modi’s three-day visit to the US comes amid human rights groups and political opponents accusing the Indian leader of stifling dissent and pursuing divisive policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities.

Elaine Pearson, Asia director for Human Rights Watch, urged Biden in a letter not to shy away from confronting Modi on India’s “worsening human rights situation”.

Her organisation plans a Tuesday screening in Washington of a BBC documentary critical of Modi that was banned by the Indian government.





The documentary delves into Modi’s oversight as chief minister of Gujarat during the deadly 2002 anti-Muslim riots that left more than 1,000 dead. Rights groups say the official death toll is an undercount.

In 2005, Washington revoked Modi’s visa to the US, citing concerns that he did not act to stop the Gujarat violence. An investigation approved by India’s Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.

More recently, Modi has faced criticism over legislation amending the country’s citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalisation for some migrants but excludes Muslims, a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists, and the recent conviction of India’s main opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modi’s surname.

“Modi’s government has also demonstrated blatant bias in protecting BJP supporters and affiliates accused in a range of crimes, including murder, assault, corruption, and sexual violence,” Pearson wrote, using the initials for Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party.

“At the international level, Modi’s government has often proven unwilling to stand with other governments on key human rights crises, abstaining or refraining from condemning grave human rights violations elsewhere.”

New Delhi-based rights activist Kavita Krishnan told Al Jazeera Biden is “acting as a propagandist for Modi by publicly saying that Modi is so popular and I should take his autograph”.

In May, during a meeting of the Quad, an international partnership of the US, Australia, India and Japan, in Hiroshima, Biden had jokingly said he should take Modi’s autograph given how tickets for the dinner he is hosting at the White House have sold out. “You are too popular,” he said.

“When you do that, it means you are actively participating in Modi’s politics where he tries to project himself as a world leader who is exceptionally popular,” Krishnan told Al Jazeera.

By doing so, she said, the US is “telling the world as well as the vulnerable people in India that human rights don’t really matter if a leader is popular”.

“Then why talk of human rights? The same then applies to Hitler, Putin, and Trump,” she said. “Why is India getting a different treatment [from US]? Is it because India is a big market and they are willing to throw Indians under the bus since they want to woo Modi? What is it? This is the question I want to ask.”





The Indian government has continually defended its human rights record and insisted that the country’s democratic principles remain robust.

India’s Russia ties

The US has also avoided publicly chastising India for its muted criticism of old ally Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and New Delhi’s growing reliance on Russian oil, which stands at 19 percent of India’s annual crude imports from two percent in 2021.

When asked by the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Monday about critical comments in the US for not taking a more forceful stance against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Modi said: “I don’t think this type of perception is widespread in the US. I think India’s position is well known and well understood in the entire world. The world has full confidence that India’s top-most priority is peace.”

Modi in the interview called for changes to global institutions like the United Nations to adapt them for an increasingly “multipolar world order”, and make them more representative of the world’s less-affluent countries.

India would like to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council, he said. “The world should be asked if it wants India to be there.”





Trade between the US and India in 2022 climbed to a record $191bn. The nearly five million Indian diaspora in the US – its wealthiest ethnic group – has become an economic, cultural and political powerhouse.

Biden has sought to reinvigorate the Quad while the US defence sales to India have risen from near zero in 2008 to more than $20bn in 2020.

Modi’s US visit begins on Wednesday when he will lead foreign dignitaries and bureaucrats in a session for International Yoga Day at the UN Secretariat in New York. Yoga, an ancient discipline first practised by Hindu sages, is now one of India’s most successful cultural exports after Bollywood.

Nine years ago, Modi successfully lobbied the UN to designate June 21 as International Yoga Day. Since then, he has harnessed yoga as a cultural soft power to stretch his nation’s diplomatic reach and project himself as an “ascetic” leader.

The official state visit portion of Modi’s trip starts on Thursday and includes an Oval Office meeting with Biden, an address to a joint meeting of Congress, and a lavish White House dinner hosted by Biden and First Lady Jill Biden.

On Friday, Modi will be honoured at a State Department luncheon hosted by Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and he is scheduled to address members of the Indian diaspora before leaving Washington.

India’s ANI news agency on Tuesday said Modi will also meet Tesla’s Elon Musk, who also owns Twitter, among other business leaders during the trip.

The Indian leader will depart for Egypt from the US for a two-day visit starting Saturday."

Companies Deals on chips, minerals, tech, space and defense

Human rights, democracy in focus

Modi addresses press, Congress

WASHINGTON, June 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and Narendra Modi hailed a new era in their countries' relationship after the White House rolled out the red carpet for the Indian prime minister on Thursday, touting deals on defense and commerce aimed at countering China's global influence.

“Two great nations, two great friends, and two great powers. Cheers,"" Biden told Modi in a toast at a state dinner. Modi said in reply: “You are soft spoken, but when it comes to action, you are very strong.”

Though the countries are not formal treaty-bound allies and India has long relished its independence, Washington wants Delhi to be a strategic counterweight to China. While neither leader criticized Beijing directly in official statements, they alluded to the Xi Jinping-led government.

""The dark clouds of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo Pacific,"" Modi told Congress. ""The stability of the region has become one of the central concerns of our partnership.""

After Biden and Modi spoke privately for more than two hours, a joint statement included a warning of rising tensions and destabilizing actions in the East and South China Sea and stressed the importance of international law and freedom of navigation.

""The challenges and opportunities facing the world in this century require that India and the United States work and lead together, and we are,"" Biden said as he welcomed Modi to the White House.

The state dinner, held in a large, elaborately erected tent on the White House South Lawn, featured a number of Silicon Valley executives on the guest list, including Apple's Tim Cook, 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, among others.

With the slightly Indian-accented dinner, the Bidens followed a White House tradition of serving guests from abroad food that has faint echoes of home with a strong American bent.

Modi is seeking to raise the status that India, the world's most populous country at 1.4 billion and fifth-largest economy, has on the world stage as a manufacturing and diplomatic powerhouse while navigating strained ties with China.

His participation in a White House press conference itself was a reflection of contrasting political traditions, marking the first time Modi has taken questions in such a format in his nine-year tenure. He took one question apiece from an American and an Indian journalist selected in advance, and dismissed criticism about India's human rights record.

Washington has been frustrated by India's close ties with Russia while Moscow wages war in Ukraine. Modi avoided direct mention of Russia, but told lawmakers the conflict was ""causing great pain in the region. Since it involves major powers, the outcomes are severe.""

BOYCOTTS AND WELCOME CROWDS

Modi's visit was not without controversy. The speech to Congress, normally a bipartisan affirmation of a visiting leader from an allied nation, was boycotted by some liberal lawmakers, who cited the Modi government's treatment of India's Muslim minority.

""I encourage my colleagues who stand for pluralism, tolerance and freedom of the press to join me in doing the same,"" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Wednesday.

Modi's speech to the Congress also drew a crowd of on-lookers who chanted ""Modi, Modi"" at applause lines.

As some 7,000 well-wishers gathered for a colorful opening ceremony at the White House, a far smaller group of demonstrators gathered blocks away to protest the Biden administration's coziness with Modi, who leads the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.

Asked by a U.S. reporter about what steps he would take to improve the rights of Muslims and other minorities, Modi said ""there's absolutely no space for discrimination"" in India.

Biden told reporters he and Modi had a straightforward discussion about democratic values.

NEW US-INDIA DEALS

The two countries announced agreements on semiconductors, critical minerals, technology, space cooperation and defense cooperation and sales.

Some are aimed at diversifying supply chains to reduce dependence on China. Others are aimed at cornering the market in advanced technologies that may feature on the battlefields of the future. They also ended disputes at the World Trade Organization, and India removed some tariffs on U.S. goods.

The United States is India's largest trading partner but the U.S. has much larger trading relationships with China, the EU, and North American neighbors.

U.S. Navy ships in the region will be able to stop in Indian shipyards for repairs under a maritime agreement, and India will procure U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.

U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology's (MU.O) plans a $2.7 billion semiconductor testing and packaging unit, to be built in Modi's home state of Gujarat. The U.S. will also make it easier for skilled Indian workers to get and renew U.S. visas.

India also agreed to join the U.S.-led Artemis Accords on space exploration and to work with NASA on a joint mission to the International Space Station in 2024.

Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said the visit so far had been ""truly pathbreaking"" and New Delhi is confident it will help take the relationship with Washington to ""higher reaches"".

""The richness of form and substance of the visit clearly tells you that it’s an exceptional, landmark, pathbreaking visit,"" Kwatra told reporters.

""The decisions taken during the visit are truly transformative across a wide range of areas. Naturally, it is something which is possible when the countries have deep trust in each other and are in it for long term.""

Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi, wrapped up his three-day state visit to the United States on Friday, June 23, 2023.



The visit was marked by announcements to expand economic engagement and resolve on both sides to elevate the bilateral relationship to a global strategic partnership. During the visit, Modi held a one-on-one conversation with US President Joe Biden ahead of the delegation-level talks. Both leaders affirmed that technology would play the defining role in deepening the partnership between India and the United States. The two leaders also highlighted the significance of the US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership and the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP) to demonstrate their commitment to climate action and clean energy.



Here are some of the major highlights of the visit:

The Indo-US Joint Statement

A joint India-US statement was issued after the visit to announce deals on semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI), telecoms, jet engine manufacturing, drones purchasing, and investments in energy and mobility sectors. The two leaders also affirmed to extend digital partnership and collaboration on sustainable development and global health. During his visit, Modi also met American CEOs from top companies including Google, Boeing, and Amazon and addressed a joint session of the US Congress.

Key takeaways from the joint statement:

India-US to enhance tech commerce Deals were announced that will strengthen semiconductor supply chains: India to receive investments from Micron Technology and Applied Materials. Lam Research to train Indian workforce.

Meeting with top American CEOs and business leaders

Prime Minister Modi interacted with CEOs and business of top American companies during a roundtable at the White House. The meeting was marked by pledges of deeper US-India cooperation on areas including space, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. After the meeting, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the tech giant is investing US$10 billion in India’s digitization fund and announced the opening of its global fintech operation center in GIFT City, Gujarat. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy took to Twitter to announce that the e-commerce giant will invest a total of $26 billion in India by 2030. In a statement, tech giant Microsoft said that its CEO, Satya Nadella, held discussion with PM Modi around the power of technology, particularly artificial intelligence, to help improve the lives of Indians.

Other CEOs present during the roundtable included Sam Altman (OpenAI), Tim Cook (Apple), and Lisa Su (AMD). Earlier, Tesla CEO Elon Musk had also met the Indian Prime Minister soon after he landed in the US.

PM Modi’s address to joint session of the Congress

Prime Minister Modi addressed a joint session of the US Congress. During his speech, PM Modi mentioned the growing Indo-US trade and economic relations and spoke on the rapid steps both countries are taking to boost strategic partnership. Here are some of the quotes from PM Modi’s speech:

Indo-US partnership

“Today, India and the US are working together in space and in the seas, in science and in semiconductors, in startups and sustainability, in tech and in trade, in farming and finance, in art and artificial intelligence.”

Climate actions

“We became the only G20 country to meet its Paris commitment. We made renewables account for over 40% of our energy sources, nine years ahead of the target of 2030. But we did not stop there. At the Glasgow Summit, I proposed Mission LiFE—Lifestyle for Environment. This is a way to make sustainability a true people’s movement.”

Women empowerment

“Today, in modern India, women are leading us to a better future. India’s vision is not just of development which benefits women, it’s of women-led development where women lead the journey of progress.”"

This editorial is based on “Old Friends in a Challenging World ” which was published in Indian Express on 26/06/2023. It talks about the recent developments in India-US relations and how their different foreign policy approaches pose major challenges in their relations.

The Prime Minister of India addressing a joint session of the US congress (a rare honour for a visiting leader from overseas) is evident of the fact that India-US relations are deepening and widening and is envisaged as “a momentous development that will benefit not just the US and India, but the world at large”.

The bilateral relations between India and the US are built upon various factors including the increasing market size of the Indian economy, growing influence of the Indian diaspora in American business and politics as well as their consensus on the need of the hour to contain Chinese aggression.

As the US deepens its Indo-Pacific engagement and India solidifies its regional prowess, the partnership between these democratic powerhouses has the potential to reshape the geopolitical chessboard.

What is the Current Scenario of India-US Relations?

Economic Progress: Bilateral trade between the two countries has grown tenfold since 2000, to USD 191 billion in 2022, and India became the 9th largest US trading partner in 2021. The rise in bilateral trade in goods and services reached ~160 billion USD in 2021. The US is India’s largest trading partner and most important export market. It is one of the few countries with which India has a trade surplus. In 2021-22, India had a trade surplus of USD 32.8 billion with the US.

Political Like-mindedness: Both the countries have like-minded views about the efficiency of IPEF for continued growth, peace, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. India has also joined the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). However, the two countries have quite contradictory responses towards the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Afghanistan issue and Iran.

Defence Cooperation: India, which could not access US weapons during the Cold War, has bought USD 20 billion worth of arms over the last two decades. However, the incentive for the US is helping India reduce its historical dependence on Russia for its military supplies. The armed forces of India and the US engage in extensive bilateral military exercises (Yuddha Abyas, Vajra Prahar) and minilateral ones with the four partners in the Quad Forum (Malabar). Another grouping in the Middle East - I2U2 involving India, Israel, UAE and the US is being termed as the new Quad

Upcoming Developments: Micron Technology (a US company) will invest around USD 2.75 billion in the next five years to build a new semiconductor assembly and test facility in India. This further involves USD 400 million investment in 4 years to set up a collaborative engineering centre along with the training of 60,000 Indian engineers. The biggest takeaway is the deal between General Electric Aerospace and HAL to manufacture under licence GE’s F414 engine for India’s light combat aircraft - this deal marks the end of the technology denial regime.

India as a US Ally: Despite vast mutual, strategic interests of the two countries, India cannot be termed as a ‘US ally’ due to its foreign policy approach of non-alignment. Indian leaders across parties and over decades have long prioritised foreign policy independence as a central feature of India’s approach to the world. Especially since the end of the Cold War, Indian leaders have sought to improve ties with the US, but not by curtailing India’s independent approach to foreign policy.

India’s ‘Multi-Aligned’ Foreign Policy: The PM of India has described the “world as one family” (vasudhaiva kutumbakam), to frame Indian diplomacy. This approach has been termed “ multialignment, ” - seeking positive ties as far and as widely as possible. Along this theory, India has carefully managed its relationships with Saudi Arabia as well as Iran; with Israel as well as the Palestinian Territories; with the US as well as Russia. India has reserved the right to engage with those who aren’t the US allies - Russia, Iran and even China - if its national interests dictate such a need.



What are the Major Challenges between India and the US?

US Criticism of India’s Foreign Policy: If the Indian elite has long seen the world through the lens of non-alignment, alliance relationships have been at the heart of US’ foreign policy since the Second World War. India’s policy of nonalignment especially during the Cold War has always been a point of concern for the West, especially the US. After the 9/11 attacks, the US asked India to dispatch troops to Afghanistan; the Indian military vetoed the request. When the US invaded Iraq in 2003, even then India’s erstwhile PM withheld military support. Even today, India refuses to toe the American line on the Russian-Ukraine war and its import of cheap Russian oil continues to break records. Pro-US voices have often been raised demanding India to get “ on the right side of history ”.

India’s Engagement with US Adversaries: India has criticised the US decision to block Iranian and Venezuelan oil from the open market. India has actively worked to bring Iran into the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organization). India has also held 18 rounds of talks with China to resolve the border dispute besides remaining a key participant in the China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

US’ Criticism of India’s Democracy: Various US organisations and foundations, from time to time, with the tacit support of some Congressmen and Senators, come out with reports questioning the present state of democratic discourse, press and religious freedom and condition of the minorities in India. Some of them include the International Religious Freedom Report 2023 and the Human Rights Report on India 2021 by the US State Department.

Economic Tensions: The Atmanirbhar Bharat Campaign has exacerbated the view in US that India is increasingly becoming a protectionist closed market economy. Effective since June 2019, the USA decided to withdraw duty-free benefits to Indian exporters under the GSP programme affecting India's export-oriented sectors such as pharma, textiles, agri products and automotive parts.



What can be Done to Improve the India-US Relations?

Moving Ahead with Multi-Alignment: With the Ukraine-Russia conflict, global powers have been realigning into new groupings. India has a tough task of walking a very tightrope between Russia and the US. India's approach, till now, has been in the best of its national interests and must continue to be so. India shall calibrate this balancing act and bring dialogue and diplomacy to resolve strong differences, and not be part of the ever-widening chasm which can only result in repercussions that go against world peace.

With the Ukraine-Russia conflict, global powers have been realigning into new groupings. India has a tough task of walking a very tightrope between Russia and the US. India's approach, till now, has been in the best of its national interests and must continue to be so. Leveraging the Best Common Interest: The new India-US defence partnership makes it possible to conceive of an Asia that is not vulnerable to domination by any one power. Increasing defence cooperation among the two countries will also help India bridge the massive gap in military capabilities with China with strong support from the US. Both India and the US have a strong interest in stabilising the Asian balance of power and coping with the geopolitical churn triggered by China’s rise and Beijing’s assertiveness in Asia.

The new India-US defence partnership makes it possible to Economic Intermingling: Indo-US economic engagement needs more ballast with greater flows of investment and trade. US investments in India are pegged at $54 billion, which represent less than 1% of its global investments. Also, India, too, needs to increase investments in the US, creating interdependencies between the two nations is crucial. Bolstering India’s strategic partnership with the US is critical for it to become a developed nation by encouraging manufacturing-led export growth and infrastructural development. This cannot succeed without greater access to the US market and technological cooperation. The India-US iCET is a step in the right direction. India’s economic rise would be in the US' interest just as much as US leadership of technology enablers and global affairs would be in India’s. This reality must not be lost in noise over India’s neutrality on the world stage and its refusal to be bound by a NATO-like-bloc.

Indo-US economic engagement needs more ballast with US investments in India are pegged at $54 billion, which Also, India, too, needs to increase investments in the US, Cooperation in Sustainable Development: Initiatives like the revamped US-India Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP) exemplify cooperation in fostering the growth of renewable energy deployment in India. The US can further assist by facilitating access to funds for India’s ambitious goals. By deepening the partnership on clean energy and climate action, both nations can achieve their global climate goals while fostering economic growth, job creation, and energy security.

Engaging Private Sectors: Many CEOs are now adopting a “China plus one” strategy, seeking to diversify their supply chains. Recently, Apple’s decision to establish its first retail store in India not only enhances the country’s attractiveness to other tech companies but also showcases its capability to produce cutting-edge technology and strengthen its manufacturing potential. This move is a crucial indication that companies are diversifying their supply chains away from China. India can also signal its readiness to become a hub for chip manufacturing and case manufacturing leveraging US’ assistance or the same.

Many CEOs are now adopting a seeking to diversify their supply chains. Recently, not only enhances the country’s attractiveness to other tech companies but also and strengthen its Expanding Coverage to Food Security: In addition to national security, food security is of equal importance to India, if not more – which, however, is being threatened by climate change with increasing temperatures affecting poorer nations disproportionately (India being no exception). The US is at the forefront of technologies not just in defence, space, and semiconductors but also in agriculture. The next round of US-India collaboration shall involve a special attempt to include food and agriculture as one of the core areas of cooperation. It has the potential to do good to the maximum number of people in the developing world, be it in Asia or Africa.

In addition to national security, food security is of equal importance to India, if not more – which, however, is being threatened by

Conclusion

The Indian prime minister put it during his address to the joint session of the US Congress -

“In the past few years, there have been many advances in AI — Artificial Intelligence. At the same time, there have been more momentous developments in another AI — America and India.” This reflects the growing relation between India and USA in the past recent years.

The prime minister — flanked by President Donald Trump, politicians from both sides of the American political aisle and all manner of captains of industry — held forth on a variety of topics in Houston at the 'Howdy, Modi!' event. Over the course of his latest outreach-to-diaspora event, Modi extolled the virtues of Indian democracy, talked up India's heritage and identity, and called for a 'decisive fight against terrorism' and those who support it. Along the way, he touched upon the oil-data analogy, rural sanitation and the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.

Immediately after came a jaunt to New York that kicked off with Modi being conferred the 'Global Goalkeeper Award' by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in recognition of the government's Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan. Next up were a series of speaking engagements at the UN (Climate Action Summit and an address on Universal Health Care), at the ECOSOC Chambers on the relevance of Mahatma Gandhi today and the Bloomberg Global Business Forum (where he delivered a keynote address). Finally, Modi spoke eloquently at the UN General Assembly, laying out the story of the tapestry that is India, sprinkled with references to history, culture, poetry, a commitment to peacekeeping missions and his own government's initiatives.

Somewhere in between was the eagerly anticipated meeting between the leaders of the oldest and the largest modern democracies. It is this aspect of Modi's US visit that will be examined closer in the following paragraphs.

Football tactics and new mobile phones

If that subhead threw you off, it's worth clarifying that this isn't an editorial SNAFU and you are still reading the same article. That said, it's worth going over a couple of case studies before venturing onward:

Case study 1: The football tactic mentioned in said subhead is less of a tactic than an unwanted byproduct of 'possession-based football' — a strategy wherein a team seeks to hang on to the ball for as long as possible in order to wear down the opposing team and force a mistake. That byproduct is known as 'stale possession', which sees midfielders passing the ball from side to side and among each other, rather than driving forward into enemy territory or retreating to a zone of defensive safety. It is called stale possession because that is exactly what it is: Stale. The ball is passed from side to side, bereft of any vision or will that culminates in it nestling in the back of the goal. The only purpose served is to keep the ball in relative safety while the clock ticks on. Elsewhere, this concept is referred to as MAFA (not to be confused with MAGA) or Mistaking Activity For Achievement.

Case study 2: Onto mobile phones and in today's world, it is highly unusual to see a week go by without the launch of a new device — regardless of whether it happens to be a small upgrade with the letter A or X or S tacked on to its name or a veritable game-changer. While most of the time, new mobile phones tend to sport minor upgrades on their previous iterations, there are a handful that arrive on the market with the burden of massive expectation — as their price tags would merit. Often, those expectations are largely fulfilled. But then there are other instances, where style is placed firmly over substance and the absence of innovation is masked by flashy bells and whistles.

Modi meets Trump

That Modi's sixth US tour since 2014 wasn't a State visit was made clear by the itinerary that indicated he was in the US to primarily speak at the United Nations on a number of topics. Accordingly, a joint statement between the prime minister and Trump was unlikely to be issued. However, and despite the somewhat over-the-top hoopla over Modi's latest tryst with the United States, it wasn't an extraordinary demand to expect him to return home with some sort of deal, agreement or understanding on paper.

While keeping expectations in the realm of reality, there were two areas in particular on which the prime minister was expected to arrive at some understanding with the president: Trade and Kashmir.

On trade, a topic Foreign Secretary Vikram Gokhale noted, had been discussed almost as much as terrorism, there appears to have been zero movement. There is reason to believe that major sticking points persist in the India-US trade relationship, particularly if the US' readout of the Modi-Trump meeting is anything to go by: ""The president reaffirmed the importance of greatly increasing trade between the United States and India, and highlighted the need for resolving barriers to free, fair, and reciprocal trade, which includes improving United States companies' market access in India"" (emphasis added).

As it stands, the two countries are embroiled in a series of disagreements at the WTO and as this article points out, ""Since 2017, the US has not held its annual dialogue on trade – US-India Trade Policy Forum – with India."" Despite growing economic tensions with China, it appears improving trade ties with India isn't on the immediate agenda for the US, and a lot more wrangling and haggling is on the cards.

When it comes to Kashmir, Trump has vacillated a great deal on where he — ergo, his nation — stands over the nearly two months since Article 370 was abrogated by the Indian Parliament. Through it all, his dream of mediating on the decades-old bilateral (in case, it needs reiteration) issue between India and Pakistan has remained intact. It has persisted through his outlandish claim in Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan's midst in July that Modi asked him to mediate between the South Asian neighbours all the way to his remarks after meeting Khan last week that ""I am ready, willing and able. It's a complex issue. It's been going on for a long time. But if both want it [mediation], I will be ready to do it"". However, in August, after meeting Modi on the sidelines of the G-7 Summit, the president had stated, ""[T]he prime minister really feels he has it (the situation) under control. They speak with Pakistan and I'm sure that they will be able to do something that will be very good... I think they can do it (resolve the issue) themselves.""

That Trump refuses to commit to a position is indicative of Trump's ambition to mediate by stealth — albeit very poorly and characterised by the singing of a different tune depending on the company he's keeping that day — and extremely unrealistically hope of making 'resolving Kashmir' his legacy. Even the US' readout of the Modi-Trump meeting mentioned that ""the president encouraged Modi to improve relations with Pakistan and fulfil his promise to better the lives of the Kashmiri people"". Being associated with 'resolving Kashmir', it would seem, is more important to Trump than the actual resolution of the issue by the two parties whom the matter affects.

Could it be that the prime minister's oratorical abilities hit the one obstacle — selling Trump India's viewpoint — it was hoped they would clear? Time will tell.

Where India-US relations are today

As it stands, relations between the two countries have been on an upward tick for the best part of two decades and the bilateral has been steadily deepening and widening — evident in the host of agreements and deals being ironed out, particularly in the realm of defence and counter-terrorism cooperation. However, there is a threat of India-US ties falling prey to the aforementioned concept of 'stale possession' or MAFA in certain other key areas, which will see both sides kicking the metaphorical ball among each other without any clearly defined path towards the goal. Certainly, diplomacy must be given time to take effect and cannot be expected to reap dividends overnight, but the near-freeze on forward movement as far as trade is concerned is worrisome.

In summation, Modi's US visit certainly was an optically-rich and flashy mega-event. However, while Trump got Modi's ringing endorsement for next year's Presidential Election and managed to keep himself in the news vis-à-vis Kashmir, the prime minister appears to have returned home almost empty-handed (save for the Global Goalkeeper Award). It's a lot like that snazzy looking mobile phone that launched to much fanfare but offered next to nothing in terms of new innovations or tech.

It's possible that the prime minister and key ministers are biding their time until 2020 — at which point, they'll know who they will have to deal with for the next four years. But for now, it seems that while the relationship isn't in decline, it's staring a plateau in the face."
300,https://swarajyamag.com/world/india-us-relations-after-modis-visit-signs-of-an-upward-trajectory-in-ties,"India-US Relations: After Modi’s Visit, Signs Of An Upward Trajectory In Ties",2017-07-01 10:39:00,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the United States (US) on 25, 26 June at the invitation of the new US President Donald trump. This was Modi's first meeting with Trump, although the two leaders had spoken to each other on three occasions after Trump won the election. One call was made by Modi and two by Trump; the last one was made at the end of March to congratulate the Indian Prime Minister for his emphatic victory in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.

Notwithstanding the pleasant and reassuring conversations held thus far, a sense of unease enveloped the visit as it approached. Several reasons contributed to this disquiet. The most recent was the outburst against India that Trump unleashed on 1 June while announcing his country’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. He accused India of demanding billions of dollars to comply with its commitments under the Paris climate accord. This was resolutely refuted by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, but the damage had seemingly already been done.

In addition, Trump’s attitude and behaviour over the last five months have given the impression that he is fickle, mercurial, unpredictable and impulsive. He has applied himself single-mindedly over this period to overturn most of the initiatives implemented by his predecessor, Barack Obama. In addition to the Paris climate agreement, he withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and is not leaving any stone unturned to reverse the policies initiated by Obama on Iran and Cuba. On the domestic front also, similar results are visible. It was feared that he might decide to put India-US relations in the neutral gear, if not reverse them. This would be a huge setback for Modi, who has invested enormous political capital and effort over the last three years in bringing bilateral ties between the two nations to where they are today.

The fact that the visit was taking place after five months of installation of Trump as US President was also commented upon adversely by several analysts as proof that India was not a priority for the new US administration. It was asserted that all major partners of the US, including Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and China, had already visited Trump. I think that this is an erroneous assessment. India itself did not wish to appear to be in a tearing hurry to come calling to Washington, DC immediately after Trump's inauguration. India wanted to bide its time. Moreover, this period gave Trump some time to settle in and deal with pressing domestic issues like immigration, jobs and healthcare. Prime Minister Modi's visit after a reasonable interregnum was considered an ideal timing to make Trump focus on the strategic partnership between India and the US. The final results have proved the validity of this assessment.

On account of the rather discouraging build-up to the visit, it was suggested that expectations should be kept modest and no big-bang announcements be expected. It was billed as a meeting for the two leaders to get to know each other.

The mood lifted perceptibly just before the onset of the visit with the tweet from President Trump, conveying his warm welcome to his “true friend”. White House announced that Modi will be accorded a red carpet welcome and he would be the first foreign leader to dine at the White House after Trump’s accession.

In the backdrop of initial apprehension, the visit can now be judged as an unqualified success.

The visit provided a valuable opportunity to the two leaders to spend time with and know each other and establish a warm, comfortable and respectful working relationship with each other. They exuded easy camaraderie and bonhomie with each other. The body language was reassuring and encouraging. In addition, several significant decisions were taken during the visit and reassurance received that the upward trajectory of the India-US bilateral ties will continue unabated.

The biggest takeaway in substantive terms was the stern language against Pakistan and the designation of Syed Salahuddin, the ‘supreme commander’ of Kashmiri militant outfit Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, as a ‘Specially Designated Global Terrorist’ because of his pronouncements to wreak havoc in Kashmir and make it a graveyard for Indian forces. This is a slap on the face of Pakistan. To compound the ignominy heaped on it, Pakistan was mentioned twice by name in the joint statement issued at the end of the visit, once to ensure that its territory is not used to launch terror strikes against other countries, and the second to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of 26/11 attack in Mumbai, Pathankot and other cross-border attacks perpetrated by Pakistan-based groups. The statement names terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and others and exhorts the international community to take united, stringent action against them.

Other actions identified by the statement include increased intelligence sharing, operational-level counter-terrorism cooperation, exchange of information on known and suspected terrorists for travel screening, strengthening information exchange on plans, movements and linkages of terrorist groups and their leaders, terror financing and so on.

The real test of the commitments assumed by the two countries will lie in action taken by them in the coming months. For the time being, all this represents a collection of pious intentions. Keeping in view the strong position of Trump against global terrorism, there are better prospects today than any time in the past that suitable action will be taken by the two countries to quell this menace.

On the subjects of regional connectivity and South China Sea (although it is not mentioned by name), India’s position has been fully echoed. The statement declares the necessity for the transparent development of infrastructure, use of responsible debt-financing practices, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, rule of law and environment. Principles of freedom of navigation, over flights, and commerce throughout the region; and need to resolve territorial and maritime disputes peacefully and in accordance with international law have been reiterated. This reaffirms that India and the US are on the same page with respect to dealing with the rapidly growing influence and presence of China in the Indian Ocean and Indo-Pacific region.

Defence has emerged as a major area of cooperation with the US surfacing as the second-largest supplier, second to Russia, of sophisticated defence equipment to India. The sale of 22 Guardian surveillance drones is on the cards and is likely to be announced shortly. Also, reports have emerged about a possible tie-up between Lockheed Martin and Tata group to locally manufacture F16 aircraft in India. This could provide a significant impetus to the ‘Make in India’ initiative.

The initial anxiety that Trump looks upon all relations in transactional terms has been belied to some extent. There was focus on the sale of 100 civil aviation planes by the US to an Indian airline as also export of natural gas, but emphasis was also placed on the strategic contents of bilateral partnership, including the situation in Afghanistan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Middle East, Pakistan, Indo-Pacific Region, India's membership of export control agreements and United Nations Security Council, cyber space, Malabar naval exercises, reaffirmation of India's designation as a ‘major defence partner’, support to the US to join as an ‘observer’ in the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium and so on.

Trade was a significant part of discussions. The two sides agreed to a comprehensive review of bilateral relations and to further expand and balance ties on the principle of free and fair trade. Trump, in his statement to the press, referred to a fair and reciprocal trading partnership between the two countries. To respond to Trump’s concerns about creating jobs in the US, Modi in his article in the Wall Street Journal said Indian investment of $15 billion in the US is creating jobs in 35 American states, including in the rust belt from where Trump received significant support during the election.

An additional aspect of the visit was the outreach to the family of Donald Trump by Prime Minister Modi. He invited Trump’s daughter Ivanka to lead a delegation of American entrepreneurs to a Global Meet in India later this year. Trump appeared immensely pleased.

The Indian foreign policy establishment can justifiably feel upbeat about the way the visit has panned out. Given the uncertainties that had plagued the journey over the last few weeks, the results have been most gratifying. Prime Minister Modi wrote in his op-ed piece in Wall Street Journal that a year ago while addressing the US Congress he had spoken about having overcome the “hesitations of history.” He affirmed that a year later, he is confident of the growing convergence between the two nations.

Prime Minister Modi’s visit has set the stage for rapid and robust growth in multi-faceted ties between India and the US in the coming years."

Prime Minister Modi arrives in Washington DC on a three-day state visit on June 21. The welcome ceremony and the state dinner along with an address to the Joint Session of the US Congress are scheduled for June 22.

Washington, Jun 14 (PTI) The US, through the official state visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is looking to convey that the relationship between India and America is of “positive strategic consequence”, the White House has said.

“The main message that we are looking to convey is that this is a relationship of positive strategic consequence,” he said.

“We think we are much more deeply aligned and significantly converging with each other on numerous global issues and innumerable ways we can benefit each of our populations.

“What you will see when Prime Minister Modi comes and is able to spend some time with President Joe Biden in this setting, is a modern relationship between two significant countries that will benefit their own people,” Finer said.

He said in just eight days, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden have the honour to receive the Prime Minister of India at the White House for an official state visit and dinner, which is the third such occasion for this administration.

“I can tell you, … how much he’s looking forward to it, how much attention to detail is given at the very highest levels for governments and it’s good evidence of that,” he said.

The two governments are deepening the strategic convergence, strengthening policy alignment to elevate and expand strategic technology and defence industrial cooperation, Finer said.

“We really believe that we now look instinctively to each other and more cooperatively, to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific to drive innovation and to jointly tackle global challenges,” the White House official said.

Observing that India and the US are natural partners, Finer said the two countries are ready to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of this unique moment together.

“Working with other like-minded partners, our countries will shape the future, working towards a world as more open and more prosperous, more secure, more stable, more resilient. This offers a brief overview of the highlights as we see them of the partnership that we are building,” he said.

India, being the major defence partner, saw the two countries consult regularly to assess regional developments and put in place an architecture to cooperate more closely through joint exercises, information sharing, logistics networks and interoperable communication systems, he said.

“We continue to strengthen India’s status as a major defence partner through defence industrial cooperation that Co-develops and co-produces important military capabilities for both of our countries,” Finer said.

“Second, our Strategic Technology Partnership. I know you’re all aware of our pathbreaking initiative on critical emerging technologies, ICET, ….which has already catalysing government, business and university cooperation in defence space semiconductors, advanced telecommunications biotechnology, emerging technologies like AI and quantum to foster an open, accessible and secure technology ecosystem,” he said.

Finer said this technology ecosystem in areas such as 5G will offer other countries beyond just US-India advanced communications alternatives that are consistent with their shared democratic values.

“Third, is our work together on the clean energy transition, the United States and India share a common vision to decarbonise our economies and deploy clean energy, which is obviously reflected in all of our country’s 2030 targets for climate action and energy,” he said.

In countries, the energy transition can be more consequential to the world than India and the US.

“Together, we are pushing each other to develop and deploy innovative solutions to strengthen climate security, expand peaceful uses of civil nuclear energy and unlock climate finance solutions, to mobilise the information technologies and the resources we need to create the clean energy economy of the future,” Finer said.

“Fourth, as two of the world’s foremost centres of innovation, we are driving prosperity together,” he said, adding that bilateral trade last year was USD 191 billion, which has nearly doubled since 2014.

India’s G-20 presidency has brought renewed focus on strengthening multilateralism and international cooperation to tackle global challenges, and achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals, he said.

“Fifth, we are welcoming new education partnerships and taking steps to support the growing demand for travel between our countries,” he said.

The US mission last year issued 125,000 visas to Indian students which is a record, Finer said, adding that Indian students are on pace soon to become the largest foreign student community in the US.

“Our relationship is also grounded in values that are cherished by both our people and our founders: democracy, pluralism tolerance, openness and respect for human rights.

“These enable us to work together and to work together with civil societies and NGOs, to build a more resilient, more peaceful, more secure, democratic society,” Finer said. PTI LKJ MRJ MRJ

His presence at the Group of 20 summit in India could reveal just how deep and sincere those friendships are.

For more than two years, Biden has been cultivating a relationship with the G20 host, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The prime minister’s home was Biden’s first stop after he arrived in New Delhi on Friday. The U.S. president received a Bollywood-style greeting after Air Force One landed, with dancers in flowing purple outfits gyrating to pop music.

Having feted Modi with a state visit to Washington in June, Biden is banking on the idea that successful diplomacy depends on personal connections. But any connection will largely be outside of the public view. White House reporters traveling with Biden were denied access to the leaders’ meeting. Indian state media released on social media pictures of the leaders during the 52-minute meeting.

A White House statement issued after the meeting reaffirmed U.S.-India partnerships on several fronts, especially with regard to computer chips, telecommunications, higher education, access to shipping lanes in the Indo-Pacific and the reduction of carbon emissions that contribute to climate change.

The two have had more than a dozen in-person or virtual engagements since 2021 as both look to tighten the U.S.-India partnership amid shared major concerns. Those include an increasingly assertive China and monumental challenges posed by climate change, artificial intelligence, global supply chain resilience and other issues.

Modi has heavily branded the summit as his own. The Indian prime minister has pictures of himself posted along the highway from the airport, greeting G20 delegates with quotes about climate change, innovation and India’s unique role as an advocate for developing countries. As a result, Biden will be something of a houseguest when he meets with his Indian counterpart.

“This meeting will be taking place at the prime minister’s residence — so it is unusual in that respect,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday aboard Air Force One. “This is not your typical bilateral visit to India with meetings taking place in the prime minister’s office.”

Biden, a center-left Democrat, and Modi, a conservative Hindu nationalist, are hardly ideological soulmates. Yet, both leaders are increasingly drawn together by China’s military and economic maneuverings in the Indo-Pacific.

India late last month lodged an objection through diplomatic channels with Beijing over China’s new standard map that lays claim to India’s territory along their shared border.

The version of the Chinese map published by the Ministry of Natural Resources website shows Arunachal Pradesh and the Doklam Plateau — over which the two sides have feuded — included within Chinese borders, along with Aksai Chin in the western section that China controls but India still claims. The Philippines and Malaysia have also lodged protests over the new Chinese map.

The map was released just days after Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on the sidelines of a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — and agreed to work to de-escalate tensions at their disputed border.

China and India have had thousands of troops facing off in a disputed region of the Himalayas since 2020, when skirmishes led to the first deadly clashes in decades. Both countries are nuclear armed.

China, which is also a member of the G20, has said that Xi will not attend this weekend’s India summit and is instead dispatching Premier Li Qiang to represent China.

Vice President Kamala Harris, in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press on the sidelines of a summit of Southeast Asian leaders in Indonesia, spoke out against China’s new map.

“It’s a violation of the law. And that’s where I put that map,” Harris told the AP.

The U.S. government outreach goes beyond Biden. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters on Friday during her fourth trip to India in the past year, that India has shown leadership in helping provide loans to developing nations as well as needed debt relief.

The White House has been tight-lipped about what will come out of Biden’s latest talks with Modi. But the administration seems eager to build on the momentum from the June state visit, which included announcements on climate, health care and space as well as some major private sector projects.

The two sides set the groundwork for U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. U.S.-based Micron Technology agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending more than $800 million and India financing the rest. The administration also plans to discuss civil nuclear issues.

The White House has sought to play down Biden and Modi ‘s differences over Russia’s war in Ukraine. India abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and refused to join the global coalition against Russia. Since the start of the war, the Modi government has dramatically increased its purchase of Russian oil.

Biden’s effort to pull India closer has been shadowed by concerns from activists and some American lawmakers about India’s human rights record under Modi.

The prime minister has faced criticism over legislation amending the country’s citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalization for some migrants but excludes Muslims, over a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists, and the recent conviction of India’s top opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modi’s surname.

India also ranks 161st out of 180 countries in this year’s Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders.

Tarapore, a research scholar at the Walter H Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University, told Vaishnav that the expectation that India would or should join the United States in a future military response to a Chinese takeover of Taiwan is the wrong benchmark with which to assess US-India security cooperation (HT Photo)

Last week on the Grand Tamasha podcast—a co-production of Carnegie and HT—host Milan Vaishnav sat down with security expert Arzan Tarapore, who published a high-profile response to Tellis, titled “America’s Best Bet in the Indo-Pacific.”

Tarapore, a research scholar at the Walter H Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University, told Vaishnav that the expectation that India would or should join the United States in a future military response to a Chinese takeover of Taiwan is the wrong benchmark with which to assess US-India security cooperation.

“How can we expect India, which is a relatively new partner of the United States with a very different history and a very different geography, to have the same degree of alignment with the United States that even treaty allies don’t have?” asked Tarapore. If even countries like France and Japan can’t have that degree of alignment, “we certainly can’t expect to India to have that degree of alignment that some people seem to expect.”

But Tarapore stressed that there’s a considerable amount the two countries can do together, short of coalition warfare. For instance, Tarapore argued that the United States should bolster India’s efforts to extend its military posture in the Indian Ocean region, support India’s development of high-value niche military capabilities and intensify its diplomatic coordination with India.

According to Tarapore, “India and the United States could develop a better combined posture in the Eastern Indian Ocean region” that includes another joint partner—Australia. “What this concretely means is having ships and aircrafts and munitions positioned…that can better safeguard Indian security interests there, as well as U.S. and Australian interests,” said Tarapore. “The three countries could share rotational deployments,” or “put their forces on the bases of the other countries.”

Tarapore also sees value in the United States and India coordinating more closely on diplomatic outreach, especially when it comes to countries in the Global South—with whom India enjoy a unique standing. “It is exactly this difference in political relationships and political interests that…could prove to be a huge asset to the partnership,” said Tarapore. “Where the United States and India agree on a common set of interests—especially revolving around Chinese coercion or aggression—India’s voice can actually help to take that common message to corners of the world where the United States does reach. In other words, the United States and India do not have to agree on everything because they agree on one big thing—China. “It is exactly that divergence between the United States and India that can prove to be an advantage it if it is mobilized…in advance of an act of aggression in the Indo-Pacific.”"

U.S.-INDIA RELATIONS

The U.S.-India strategic partnership is founded on shared values including a commitment to democracy and upholding the rules-based international system. The United States and India have shared interests in promoting global security, stability, and economic prosperity through trade, investment, and connectivity. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi have held two in person bilateral meetings during which they reaffirmed their commitment to a resilient, rules-based international order that safeguards sovereignty and territorial integrity, upholds democratic values, and promotes peace and prosperity for all. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi have also participated in multiple engagements of the Quad Leaders mechanism with Japan and Australia. The United States supports India’s emergence as a leading global power and a vital partner in efforts to safeguard the Indo-Pacific as a region of peace, stability, and growing prosperity. The strong people-to-people ties between our countries, reflected in the four million-strong Indian American diaspora and vibrant educational exchange between the two countries, are a tremendous source of strength for the strategic partnership. The 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue between the U.S. Secretaries of State and Defense and their Indian counterparts is the premier recurring dialogue mechanism between the United States and India. The United States hosted the fourth 2+2 Dialogue in April 2022.In addition to the 2+2 Dialogue, the United States and India cooperated in dozens of bilateral dialogues and working groups, which span all aspects of human endeavor, from space and health cooperation to energy and high technology trade. These include the U.S.-India Counterterrorism Joint Working Group, which was established in 2000, as well as the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership, Climate Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue, Cyber Dialogue, Civil Space Working Group, the Education and Skills Development Working Group, Trade Policy Forum, Defense Policy Group, and Counternarcotics Working Group.

Economic Relations

In 2021, overall U.S.-India bilateral trade in goods and services reached a record $157 billion. The United States is India’s largest trading partner and most important export market. Many U.S. companies view India as a critical market and have expanded their operations there. Likewise, Indian companies seek to increase their presence in U.S. markets and at the end of 2020, Indian investment in the United States totaled $12.7 billion, supporting over 70,000 American jobs. The nearly 200,000 Indian students in the United States contribute $7.7 billion annually to the U.S. economy.

International Cooperation

India and the United States cooperate closely at multilateral organizations, including the United Nations, G-20, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization. The United States welcomed India joining the UN Security Council in 2021 for a two-year term and supports a reformed UN Security Council that includes India as a permanent member. India is an ASEAN dialogue partner, an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development partner, and an observer to the Organization of American States. Together with Australia and Japan, the United States and India convene as the Quad to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific and provide tangible benefits to the region. In June of 2022, the Quad countries concluded recruitment for the inaugural Quad Fellows, an opportunity for 100 students, 25 each from Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, to pursue a master’s or doctoral studies in STEM in the United States. India is also one of twelve countries partnering with the United States on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) to make our economies more connected, resilient, clean, and fair. India is a member of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), at which the United States is a dialogue partner. In 2021, the United States joined the International Solar Alliance headquartered in India, and in 2022 the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha Power became Co-chair of the Governing Council of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) where India is a permanent co-chair.

While the United States and India expressed positive progress in their bilateral relationship, both avoided mentioning what brought them together in the first place: both countries have complex and significant relationships with China. What do Modi’s U.S. visit and the evolving U.S.-India relationship reveal about both countries’ geopolitical positions in Asia—and their strategies to manage relations with China?

Dr. Kanti Bajpai, vice dean and professor of international relations at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy based at the National University of Singapore, joins the National Committee to share an Indian point of view on relations between China, India, and the United States.

Kanti Bajpai Kanti Bajpai is a professor of international relations at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. Before coming to the LKY School, Kanti was Professor of International Politics, Jawaharlal Nehru University and Professor in the Politics and International Relations of South Asia, Oxford University.

He is currently working on a book on India’s grand strategy.

Transcript

Does India view China as a partner, competitor, or strategic threat?

Kanti Bajpai: In the Indian mind, all of those things are true. Of course, the relationship, particularly since 2020, when there was a fracas at a place called Galwan and Indian lives were lost and some Chinese lives were lost, since then, the relationship has entered a kind of freeze, both metaphorically and diplomatically and militarily.

So, I think it’s fair to say that the relationship is not in great shape. India insists that there can’t be business as usual with China until the Chinese pull out of areas that they came into in 2020, and some other incursions since then which haven’t been quite as dramatic. But there hasn’t been much of a movement backwards by the Chinese.

There have been some retractions of forces, but not to the extent of the status quo ante. So, I think, you know, that’s on the one hand. On the other hand, I think it’s fair to say that neither government has over-reacted and the Indian government has quite markedly, significantly, cautious. It’s insisting that the Chinese pull out forces, but in fact, there’s quite a lot of business as usual as well.

And in fact, business—last year, bilateral trade between India and China was the highest ever. You know, after a couple of years of a downturn, partly due to COVID, partly due to the fracas at Galwan, trade resumed to the highest level ever. So, there’s that degree of normalness. The two have embassies that are functioning normally between the two countries.

The leaderships have met, at least, at the foreign minister and other level on the sidelines of mini-lateral or multilateral meetings. You know, [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi has shaken hands with Xi Jinping at one of those. There hasn’t been a great interchange at the highest level, but India clearly is not ready for that until there’s progress on the border issue.

So, I think things are fraught and cold, but they’re not likely to blow up into something really untoward and unmanageable. I think both sides have been careful to continue some dialogue, continue normal interactions where they can, in mini-lateral, multilateral trading areas, and that’s where it is.

In terms of, you know, the recent visit of Modi, I mean, it’s very clear that China is what drives India and the United States together. It’s not the convergence of political values so much, whatever the two leaderships might have said, and especially whatever Mr. Modi might have said, about democracy in common. And nobody takes that seriously, frankly.

And it’s not such a massive economic relationship, although at about $180 or $190 billion in bilateral trade, India has peaked with America as well in terms of trade. But it’s really the strategic challenge, the common strategic challenge of China. They won’t say it openly, but of course everyone recognizes it and so does Beijing.

I think the interesting thing is that it’s probably Delhi that insists that China is not mentioned in the various statements, public or more private. Even at the height of the Galwan fracas with the Chinese, even as India received a certain amount of intelligence and some equipment for high mountain warfare and so on that it needed but it didn’t possess, which it got from the United States, New Delhi made it very clear at that point that it didn’t want very overt American statements of support for India because that might polarize the situation even more. So, I mean, oddly, it’s India, which is in the front lines with China, which is very, very cautious about, you know, a joint statement with the Americans over China.

Look at India’s behavior in the Quad and in the Indo-Pacific. I think it’s widely acknowledged that India is the weak link there, that it tends to water down any suggestion that this is a common front against China. And it’s only after Galwan, for instance, that India agreed to higher-level meetings of officials in those two forums. Before that, India was tended to downplay both the Indo-Pacific and the Quad.

So Delhi is very, very cautious about offending China.

What hesitations does India have about its relationship with the United States?

Kanti Bajpai: Look at the way that S. Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, has spoken about Western countries, including the American media, not so much the American government, but about the American media over any criticism in the West over two things. One, India’s stand on the Ukraine war. India won’t even call it a war.

It’s with the Russians on that. And the second issue is, of course, democracy, human rights, liberalism. So any criticism in the West, either at the official level or—[Indian Foreign Minister S.] Jaishankar, I mean, is brutal about it. At the same time, he makes no statements about Russia or China of any kind of criticism of their behavior, even though, particularly with China, there’s a real problem.

I mean, all he’s saying to Beijing is “get out of our territory,” and that’s about all he will ever say. So, I think before everyone gets carried away about the United States and India as partners, India’s fundamental international outlook is much closer to that of Russia and China than it is to the United States.

And let me give you an instance. If you look at the February 4th statement of Putin and Xi Jinping, which is about three weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine, that statement contains—implied a direct criticism of the existing world order backed by the United States liberal internationalism that whole package of things.

There’s nothing there that New Delhi would be uncomfortable with in that statement, except for the one criticism that did bite India, and that was the criticism of the Indo-Pacific and the Quad that India would be a little unhappy about in that statement. But otherwise, it would be happy to associate itself with pushback against liberal internationalism, against making democracy a big deal, or human rights a big deal, the domination of the West of international institutions, the need for multipolarity, multilateralism, and it’s all bread and butter stuff for India, all the dog whistles that Indian foreign policy is associated with.

So, no quarrel with the Russians and Chinese over that. The quarrel is with Western dominance and Western policies on human rights and democracy. So I don’t want to exaggerate this convergence with the United States, and I think it’s very, very apparent if you look carefully at statements and behavior on the Indian side.

I think it’s fair to say that even before Narendra Modi, India used to push back and was an uncomfortable about any criticism of its domestic politics. So, you know, it’s not new with Modi. It’s just much more pugnacious in terms of the response to these things. I mean, you just have to look at Foreign Minister Jaishankar’s behavior over the last few months, last year or so.

I mean, he’s become India’s wolf warrior, in effect. But yes, I mean, a lot depends on how the Americans handle it as well. In the visit with Biden just now, clearly Biden underplayed the human rights, democracy angle. And, you know, America has a history of squaring these circles. Look at Saudi Arabia and the relationship with the Saudis, [or] with East Asian countries such as South Korea back in the day before democracy broke out.

[Americans] worked very carefully and easily with the South Koreans. You know, America has a whole history of working with illiberal, dictatorial countries when it suits its strategic interests. Pakistan, for instance, other Middle Eastern countries, countries in Latin America, and so on. So I think, when we say America, of course, there are all kinds of different constituencies and players.

Congressmen may have a slightly different point of view. Some congressmen in the American media have a different perspective. Think tanks and so on might say something contradictory to the government. But the White House and the leadership of national security and foreign policy have to be attentive to making partnerships, even if political values differ. And I think, you know, at the end of the day, it’s very clear that the China problem is so severe—or is thought to be—for both the Americans and Indians that they will find a way, despite the tensions over political values, to do business together.

How much is concern about China driving the United States to strengthen its relationship with India?

Kanti Bajpai: No one now has too many illusions in the United States about India being a liberal country. But, you know, I think the issue really is that India’s size means that it’s the only country around the world, and certainly in Asia, that if its economics finally kind of take off, it’s the only one that can be a counterpoint to China in the long run.

So the United States and India are united by the idea that even though they may not be allies in a formal sense or even very deep military partners, what this relationship about is really about now is what the United States has done with other partners in the past, including China in the second half of the Cold War, which is start to transfer technology and develop a series of economic links and develop other capacities in a putative partner.

So that that partner becomes an economic powerhouse, a technological player as well. And, you know, therefore develops its own economic and military capabilities in the long term so that in effect, India would become an existential balancer against China. It doesn’t have to be a balancer in league with the Americans. Its own natural rivalry with China will put it in the forefront of being a balancer.

The Chinese will always have to look sideways to the West at India as India grows, and if the Americans can help India grow economically and that mission is achieved, then the natural rivalry and balancing between China and India will play to their advantage. So what the Americans want, above all, is for India to take care of business by itself, in a sense, with some help to become an economic force, military force, and not go over to the Chinese side.

I mean, that’s the nightmare scenario: that India doesn’t remain more or less kind of neutral-to-soft-tilt towards the United States, but actually goes the other way. That would be a problem for Washington. So the issue is not to sign up India necessarily to a grand alliance, but to build it into an existential balancer against China.

And make sure it doesn’t go over to the other side. I mean, I think that would be the extent of American calculations.

Could there be an India-China rapprochement?

Kanti Bajpai: What would it take for India and China to become closer, and maybe even switch sides, for India to switch sides? I mean, I did point out earlier that fundamentally India’s view of a preferred world order does incline towards Russian and Chinese preferences much more than, say, American.

So, I mean, I don’t want to exaggerate that point because even Russia and China buy into many of the fundamentals of the existing order, but there are certain elements that they don’t agree with, particularly the liberalism of the current order, and that’s where India falls out as well. So, you know, I mean, I think if I was in Beijing, I would be cultivating India against the liberal-ness of this current order that could help flip India.

Of course, a Chinese withdrawal to positions before that Galwan incursion would make it much easier for Delhi to flip sides. And so I think if Xi Jinping wanted to make a gesture that would be really meaningful, he could come to a quick bargain over at least those incursions. Thirdly, of course, if the Chinese were in a mood to compromise much more ambitiously over a final settlement of the border, that could be a complete game changer because that we take away the main structural problem, one of the main structural problems between India and China.

There’s always a structural problem of the level of the power rivalry. So even if you took away the border problem, you know, these two big countries would still be eyeing each other a little bit in terms of their power dynamics. But at least that huge historical sediment would go away and, you know, there’d be a very real possibility that India could be flipped.

So I think those are at least three things that China could do. And China has shown that it’s not above making some of these very big kinds of decisions when it’s in its interest to do so and when it has a supreme leader who feels he has the capacity and flexibility to do so. Is Xi a Deng Xiaoping or a Mao? I think there’s a view that he’s that powerful.

I myself am a bit skeptical. And you know for one reason, my skepticism really rests on the issue of not so much Xi Jinping, but Chinese society, which is with social media and all of that. There is something like public opinion out there in China that I think even Xi has to be very careful about. And a lot of it is focused on, you know, recovering the homeland and not giving away territory.

So [there is] pressure on Xi Jinping to do something about Taiwan, Hong Kong, which I guess now is accomplished, and then the really other outstanding problem is the border with India. That chunk of land, at least in Chinese eyes, is even larger than Taiwan. So, you know, I mean, I think much as Xi Jinping might be able to pull off an ambitious deal, certainly he would have resistance in the system to it.

I don’t think there’s much India can do to really make a dramatic breakthrough in the relationship. Mr. Modi is not strong enough to do that at home. Xi Jinping is stronger, but even he faces a problem. So overall, I would say that I don’t think Washington needs to worry too much.

But there is one thing that Washington should be aware of. If American criticism of India on human rights, liberalism, democracy becomes more extreme, then you could see Delhi being pushed into the China-Russia camp. And so I think that’s where Washington has to take a call, has to play it very carefully.

And the scenario you outlined, if there’s a U.S.-China rapprochement of some kind, then things would become very fluid. Would India then try to play up to the United States or would it then find itself reaching out more to China so that it’s not dealt out of the game completely? So I think there are dynamic scenarios and possibilities, but everything points to a situation still where China and India are not going to be very good friends.

Could India pose a military threat to China along the India-China border?

Kanti Bajpai: Well, I don’t think there’s any possibility of that, frankly. India doesn’t have the ability to project that kind of military force in Arunachal Pradesh or Ladakh. It can hold the Chinese, at least for the foreseeable future, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh, probably, where geography helps it. The mountains, terrain and so on, make it difficult for the Chinese as well.

But in Ladakh, where the ingress areas are much flatter, it could be much more difficult. But the long and the short of it is that India simply does not have the capacity to project force into Tibet from either in the eastern sector, which is Arunachal, or in the western sector, which is Ladakh. So I don’t see any possibility of India kind of opening up a front against China opportunistically to recover what it sees as rightful territories.

And by the way, India is very cautious about how much territory it’s actually lost. And nor will it open up another front to help the Americans and the Japanese and the Taiwanese out in a fight against the Chinese. But in any case, I mean, I think regardless of all of that Indian behavior, the Chinese have enough deterrent capability in Tibet to deal with virtually any Indian attack, even at a time when they might be fighting on another front.

How likely is it that India would help the United States in the event of U.S.-China military conflict?

Kanti Bajpai: I think the idea that India might open up another front for its own reasons, or to help out the Americans and so on, is quite a fantastic idea. It’s just not in the realm of possibility. Nor is it very credible that India would open up a maritime front against the Chinese and, you know, sort of intercept Chinese ships in the Strait of Malacca and so on.

At least a couple of reasons for that. One are Indian naval limitations and the strength of the Chinese, and that includes Indian air power. But the other is, if there’s a full-fledged conflict in the Taiwan Strait and extending into areas such as the South China Sea, which is adjacent to the Malacca Strait, it’s the American navy, perhaps with its allies, the Japanese and the Australians, who are going to stop the Chinese in and around the Malacca Strait.

I don’t think they need the Indian navy very much. And the Americans will take care of business there if they can. And as for commercial traffic being stopped, well, what commercial traffic would want to go into the South China Sea and into the Taiwan Strait where there’s a war going on? So the idea that the Indian navy would be there to keep the strait open or to choke off, say, Chinese shippers that are carrying stuff back to China, I don’t think any Chinese commercial shipping will be heading to the South China Sea or the [Taiwan] Strait when there’s a war going on.

I just don’t see this idea of the Indian navy being a factor in the Bay of Bengal up to the Malacca Strait. And certainly the Indian navy can’t project much power beyond the Strait of Malacca. It’s a non-factor. And the Indian Navy, as it says it publicly, has no ability to project force beyond the Malacca Strait.

So, you know, I think India is simply not a factor in a Taiwan fight. At best, because there’s a logistical agreement and various other intelligence agreements with the Americans, if Washington activates those during a fight with China over Taiwan, India would have to make a decision. Now, one of the things that hasn’t been picked up in the Modi-Blinken joint communique or statement after the visit is that there’s a couple of lines in there about how India will serve as a hub to service American warships and so on should they need that facility.

So that’s a possibility that the Americans will call in India to honor that agreement and to furnish maybe a certain amount of intelligence. Although, to be frank, the Americans have such enormous worldwide in intelligence capability, that I’m not sure that India can add much. It was the Americans who gave India intelligence on the Galwan incursion that India didn’t have, that’s right there on India’s border.

The Americans knew more than the Indians knew, perhaps. So I think even this idea that they would play much of an intelligence sharing role in a Taiwan fight seems to be, you know, looking for something, some sort of peanut butter to put on the sandwich. But at best, I think, some American ships coming back from the theater or proceeding to the South China Sea might need rest and recreation or stop off some servicing.

And, you know, and repair and maintenance. That’ll be a decision point for India. I wouldn’t bet on India saying yes.

How have Indian opinions toward the United States changed over time?

Kanti Bajpai: Indian opinion on America has changed. And just in the wake of the Modi visit, a poll from yesterday shows that 65% of Indians are quite favorably disposed towards the United States. But this is soft opinion. You know, it could change very, very rapidly under the pressure of events. What is still true is that because of the colonial era and the Cold War, there’s a lot of anti-Americanism in India even now just below the surface.

And if you look at Twitter commentary, for instance, during the first weeks and months of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with so much anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism on display there in the Indian elite commentary, it was all America’s fault, NATO’s expansion, you know, sympathy for Putin and Russia, which are India’s great friends going back, you know, the Cold War and so on and so forth.

And by God, the Americans were going to be taught a lesson. And America is a country in decline. And I mean, just unsupported, you know, kind of opinion and commentariat type of stuff. But, you know, it’s revealing that at an elite level and at some popular level, there are very mixed views of the United States. And by the way, that’s true in the current Indian government.

I mean, please don’t imagine that Mr. Modi and his government all love the United States. Barack Obama made a couple of remarks about India’s treatment of minorities and just look at the pushback from two Indian cabinet ministers and other BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party, India’s ruling party) functionaries against them but two days after the Modi visit. So, you know, just below the surface, there is a lot of anti-Americanism.

And it’s partly colonialism, America being the successor to—another big Western state that bullies other countries, quote unquote, and all of that. So, you know, it’s mixed up with India’s colonial legacy and anti-Westernism. It’s related to a robust sense of India wanting to be its own player and count for something in the world as a great civilization and its sense that it’s been historically demeaned by Western countries, including the Americans and so on.

So, you know, there’s a whole reservoir of—having said that, yeah, the last 20 years have seen a softening of Indian opinion towards the United States. There’s a diaspora there. So, there are all kinds of social links to the United States. And for all the Indian elite’s criticism of America, all their children are going to study in the United States and hanker after a green card there.

So, you know, there are a lot of contradictions and posturing and bad faith in a lot of these statements. But on the whole, yeah, there’s been an improved view of the United States. But I would caution, again, it won’t take much for that opinion to flip into outright public anti-Americanism. And if the Americans were to do something different with Pakistan tomorrow or started flying towards China a bit more, things could change quite a bit.

So it’ll always be in India an ambivalence towards Western countries, and particularly the United States, because it’s the leading Western country, a view that it’s a neo-imperialist power and that it is unreliable and often demeaning of India. I think that’s something that the United States has to be aware of. I think Indian decision makers also are quite aware of it and take some trouble to make sure that they’re not seen in the company of Westerners too much.

And I think part of the kind of restraint that India shows, too, with China, for instance, is that it wants to make clear to the West and to the United States that the West should not take India for granted, that it will maintain links to China and keep its options, quote unquote, open. And so I think India plays a very careful game there, civilizationally, diplomatically, politically, militarily of staying between China and the United States."
309,https://www.9dashline.com/article/the-us-india-partnership-after-modis-visit-to-washington,9DASHLINE — The US-India partnership after Modi’s visit to Washington,,"Early in June, the US Indo-Pacific Coordinator, Kurt Campbell, expressed hope that Narendra Modi’s recent visit to Washington DC would ""consecrate"" India as the United States’ most important partner. Following the visit on 22 June, the two sides agreed to deepen ties across technology, defence, economic, and people-to-people domains. India even received technology-sharing deals traditionally reserved for US allies. As the United States adapts to rising strategic competition with China, it has sought to strengthen ties with New Delhi as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific.

As US-India relations are strengthening, China-India relations are continuing to deteriorate, reaching their lowest point in decades with unresolved border tensions at the forefront of the downturn in relations. Over the last 10 years, India has lost nearly 40 per cent of its patrolling posts in Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Recent polling by Tsinghua University reveals that only eight per cent of Chinese respondents have a favourable view of India, lower than the percentage of favourable views toward the United States and Japan. To make matters worse, India and China recently expelled nearly all of each other's journalists, implemented mutual business restrictions, and are continuing to compete for influence in South Asia.

Even as New Delhi and Washington’s interests converge over mutual mistrust of Beijing, many analysts have questioned India’s value as a US security partner. Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace recently argued that Washington should not hold any “delusions of New Delhi becoming a comrade-in-arms during some future crisis with Beijing”. Similarly, a new RAND report suggests that New Delhi displays “no evidence of being willing to volunteer to join a war that does not directly involve” India’s interests.

As the United States adapts to rising strategic competition with China, it has sought to strengthen ties with New Delhi as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific.

Nonetheless, New Delhi may not need to get directly involved in a potential US-China contingency to be pivotal in a time of crisis. There is a range of actions, from logistical support to joint deterrence, that India could take to provide both strategic and tactical benefits to the United States in the event of a Western Pacific contingency. The possibility that India might get involved in a US-China crisis alone would be enough to deflect some of Beijing’s resources and attention from the direct zone of conflict. As the two sides work to continue to deepen their security relationship, Washington should not give up on the prospect of New Delhi’s growing appetite for defence cooperation.

Shared concerns and mutual interests

While many analysts point to the 2020 Galwan border clashes as the inflection point in India-China tensions, bilateral suspicions began rising years before, due to the growing assertiveness of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Western Theater Command. Not only did India and China face off at the Depsang Plains in 2013, but three years later several PLA officers involved in those clashes were also promoted to senior positions in the Tibetan Military District and the Western Theater Command.

Tensions then peaked with the May 2020 Galwan clash. While New Delhi claimed that Chinese border violations eroded the “entire basis” of India-China ties, Beijing attempted to put the border issue in an “appropriate place” in the bilateral relationship. At the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit this April, China portrayed the border situation as “stable”, even though the two sides clashed just months before, in December 2022, at Tawang.

Amid India’s estrangement from China, New Delhi’s underlying motive for strengthening relations with Washington is not solely to oppose Beijing but to cement its role as a rising great power. Therefore, India has joined US-led groupings like the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) along with participating in other coalitions such as BRICS and the SCO. However, India often recoils when the latter organisations try to insert language in support of Chinese initiatives, such as BRI projects, Beijing’s Global Security Initiative, or counter-terrorism efforts that do not target anti-India extremist groups in Pakistan.

During the Cold War, India partnered with the Soviet Union to avoid domination by either the United States or China. Today, the United States and India have discovered that common anxieties regarding China’s potential domination of Asia are bringing them closer together. As India’s threat perception of China continues to grow, India will find greater security cooperation with Washington — short of being a formal ally — ever more palatable.

India in a US-China confrontation

It is true that India will likely seek to avoid the costs of any conflict that does not directly bear on New Delhi's interests as much as possible, including in the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea. India’s emphasis on economic development clashes with any desire to get directly involved in such a hypothetical military contingency. On the other hand, India’s security interests and great power aspirations do not start and stop at the Sino-Indian border. New Delhi recognises that China's increasingly destabilising role in the Indian Ocean and larger Indo-Pacific undermines its own security. A scenario in which the United States loses a kinetic conflict with China and is pushed from East Asia would exacerbate India’s own vulnerability to Chinese domination.

Viewed through an economic lens, India may be reluctant to get involved in a US-China conflict to insulate its own economy. The reality, however, is that a major conflict, even far afield from India’s borders, would severely damage the Indian economy. Deterring and preventing potential Chinese aggression against its neighbours would serve India’s economic interests. In the security domain, India has an abiding interest in preventing Chinese hegemony not only along the Sino-Indian border but throughout the Indo-Pacific. If Beijing were to succeed in “reunifying” with Taiwan, the India-China border would become one of China’s last remaining territorial disputes, and India would be more vulnerable to Chinese pressure.

Even as it faces incursions along the border, India remains committed to improving its maritime capabilities to match the growth of the PLA Navy. New Delhi recently redoubled its military build-up at the Andaman and Nicobar Islands bases in the Bay of Bengal, just northeast of the Malacca Strait. In September 2022, India launched its first domestically built aircraft carrier, and in June 2023 the Indian Navy took part in twin-carrier exercises demonstrating improved interoperability with US and Japanese forces.

India’s naval bases at the mouth of the Malacca Strait give it a unique ability to apply pressure on China by leveraging access to important commercial shipping lanes. New Delhi could grant the United States and its partners access to these islands for logistical, as well as intelligence, support. Even if the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are not operationalised during a Western Pacific contingency, India’s decision to expand its capabilities in advance of any such crisis would enhance joint deterrence, complicating China’s strategic calculations against Taiwan.

Although Taiwan remains a far more important core territorial interest to China when compared with Aksai Chin or Arunachal Pradesh, the PLA still must prepare for the risk of a potential border conflict with India. This leaves Beijing in a tenuous position where it remains vulnerable to Indian pressure on disputed border territories while the bulk of its forces remains focused on preparing for a Taiwan contingency.

Indian geostrategist Brahma Chellaney recently proposed that an Indian escalation on the border in the event of an imminent Taiwan invasion could force China to consider a wider range of threats. Thus, deterrence signalling on the China-India border before a potential Taiwan invasion could be as important as any direct intervention in a US-China contingency. Joint deterrence by India and the United States would necessitate stronger strategic linkages between New Delhi and Washington to coordinate and manage the risks of escalation.

A partnership with teeth

While the degree of India’s involvement in a US-China conflict will depend on India’s threat perception of China, there is little to suggest that China and India plan to de-escalate soon. Although narratives in Chinese state media argue that Washington is to blame for rising China-India tensions, Chinese attempts to separate India from the United States have been largely unsuccessful. The confluence of India’s own strategic concerns and great power ambitions have facilitated its alignment with the United States.

Since the United States designated India as a Major Defense Partner in 2016 and elevated New Delhi to the status of Strategic Trade Authorization Tier 1 in 2018, the US-India relationship has become broader and deeper. The two countries now exchange vast quantities of military and dual-use technologies, conduct joint military exercises, and engage in intelligence-sharing bilaterally, as well as through the Quad.

Prime Minister Modi’s recent visit to Washington solidified new agreements to transfer critical jet technology, cooperate on spaceflight, purchase armed drones, and pursue joint research on semiconductor breakthroughs. In the aftermath of Modi’s state visit, more important than any single deliverable, the tone of the US-India relationship has shifted to one of long-term alignment.

U.S.-India relations entered a new chapter as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden announced a slew of technology and defense deals. ""When India and the U.S. work together on semiconductors and critical minerals, it helps the world in making supply chains more diverse, resilient and reliable,"" Modi said during a speech to the joint session of the U.S. Congress. ""We were strangers in defense cooperation at the turn of the century, but now the United States has become one of our most important defense partners."" Former diplomats and analysts told CNBC they only expect that relationship to grow stronger and generate even more deals. That includes more military agreements, according to Atul Keshap, president of the U.S.-India Business Council, and former charge d'affaires at the United States Embassy in New Delhi said. ""It's going to be great for democracy, great for our two countries, and frankly, great for the Indo-Pacific and the world. So I'm feeling very bullish and I'm really quite impressed by the deliverables that have been announced by both governments,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Friday.

The two nations strengthened their defense partnership this week, striking deals that include building General Electric F414 jet engines in India and repairing deployed U.S. Navy ships in Indian shipyards. Still, the U.S. and India are not allies and their relationship will be very different from what other countries in the region have with Washington. ""The Biden administration has placed a huge bet on the strategic and economic relationship. And that is not contingent upon India supporting the United States down the line. It's not an ally relationship, but it is one of equal partners and equal strategic interest,"" said Raymond Vickery, senior associate in U.S.-India policy studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said.

More tech deals on the horizon

The U.S. and India are also expected to reach more deals on technology in the future, as Washington pursues ""friend-shoring"" — a strategy in which it diversifies away from China and taps into the potential of other countries in the region. ""India needs cutting edge technology. And I think Americans have become much more open about sharing those critical technologies and moving in a direction, which also helps India build its own defense manufacturing base,"" said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at Observer Research Foundation, a Delhi-based think tank. The U.S. and India agreed to work together across space and artificial intelligence, while also collaborating to secure resilient critical minerals supply chains.

""These are bound to lead to further deals [as] the habit of partnership and confidence in the relationship grows further,"" said Arun Singh, non-resident senior fellow at Carnegie India. ""The U.S. understands that the human tech capital is a very important part of U.S. global leadership in innovation,"" said Singh, who previously served as India's ambassador to the United States. ""Indian origin tech entrepreneurs and Indian origin CEOs were an integral part of U.S. leadership in innovation,"" he said, adding that Modi's state visit has further cemented U.S. investments in Indian critical technology areas.

Don't expect a free-trade agreement soon

The joint statement noted Modi ""expressed India's interest towards being recognized as a Trade Agreements Act-designated country by the United States to further enhance the integration of both economies and to further promote trade and investment between two countries."" Despite the cozier relationship, ORF's Pant said a free-trade agreement is unlikely in the short to medium term. ""Comments from both sides of the political aisle show that there is no real willingness to move forward on free-trade agreements … That seems to be the bottleneck at the moment,"" he said.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet President Joe Biden on Thursday during his first state visit to the U.S. High on the agenda will be deepening of defense ties, partnerships in technology and India's role in the Indo-Pacific. Ties between India and the U.S. are at a turning point and the relationship between the two nations have improved in the last decade, said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at Observer Research Foundation, a Delhi-based think tank. ""This is a very important visit, it is as much about India reaching out to the U.S., as it is about the U.S. reaching out to India,"" Pant said. Biden has only hosted two state visits during his presidency, the first with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in December 2022, and the second with South Korea's president Yoon Suk Yeol in April. ""This visit symbolizes the unwavering commitment to deepening ties and signifies the immense potential for both countries to collaborate amidst global challenges,"" Farwa Aamer the director of South Asia initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said. ""For many in India and the U.S., the visit is a testament to the promise and high expectations for the future of U.S.-India collaboration — one of shared prosperity,"" Aamer said. The U.S. is looking at India as a partner it can rely on, but its partnership will be very different since India is not an ally, Pant told CNBC. ""The U.S. is not used to having partners that are not allies, but is willing to look at its partnership with India differently — one that is relatively independent minded but will help American priorities as well,"" he said in a phone interview.

Strengthening defense ties

India and Russia have long shared a steadfast relationship, with India relying heavily on the Kremlin for oil and military weapons. The South Asian nation is the world's largest buyer of Russian arms, accounting for approximately 20% of Russia's current order, Reuters reported. ""India has been too dependent on one country and that is not good, and although dependence has dropped from 80% in the 1990s to about 65% now, dependence is still huge,"" Pant pointed out. However, because of the war in Ukraine, Russia has not been able to send critical defense weapons it had promised India, pushing the Indian military to look to others — such as the U.S. — for supplies.

Still, analysts are optimistic that the meeting between Biden and Modi could lead to more weapons agreements. India has long been interested in buying SeaGuardian drones from the U.S., but the hoped-for deal that could be worth between $2 billion to $3 billion has been long hampered by ""bureaucratic stumbling blocks,"" Reuters reported. The deal could still be brought back to the table. ""India's Ministry of Defense has reportedly approved the purchase so it seems likely. The U.S. would like this to go through,"" Manjari Miller, senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations told CNBC. ""It would be important for the partnership — only a few military allies and NATO countries have this drone, and the U.S. is particular about whom it sells U.S. weapons and technology to."" She highlighted that now is an important time for the deal to come through as it will draw ""India closer into the U.S. defense orbit, and is a step away from India's dependence on Russian arms and equipment."" India is undermining its strategic options by thinking it can continue to rely on Russia, Lisa Curtis, senior fellow and director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. ""It wants to try to keep a wedge between Russia and China because it doesn't want to contemplate the idea of Russia and China both arrayed against it. Then you throw Pakistan in there and things look really dire from the Indian perspective,"" Curtis told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The drones will also enhance the Indian armed forces ""intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance capabilities"" that will aid the country in securing their borders with China and Pakistan, Karthik Nachiappan, research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore said. Tensions between India and China over the disputed border in the Himalayan region has been ongoing since the 1950s with no end in sight. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in June 2020 in hand-to-hand combat with Chinese troops, followed by another clash in December 2022. But India wants to ""go beyond a buyer-seller relationship,"" with the U.S., Pant said adding that India is working toward a ""co-production and co-development relationship"" with the U.S. so it can build its own domestic manufacturing defense base. Private sectors in the U.S. could also start making more significant investments in India, with the two countries set to work together on producing fighter jet engines, said Pant. ""There's a change in the way the U.S. looks at India, and defense will be a beneficiary of that. India will definitely be looking to reduce its dependence on Russia, and that will be quite an extreme move,"" he added. Without mentioning China, the White House said in May the visit will ""strengthen our two countries' shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space."" ""Both the United States and India share the objective of not having an Asia that is dominated by China, or an Indo-Pacific region that is subject to Chinese coercion and assertiveness,"" said Ashley Tellis, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in a Q&A report.

Energy: Reliance on Russian oil

Although India's purchase of Russian weapons could fall, the same can't be said for oil. When Western nations imposed sanctions on Russian oil as a result of the unprovoked war in Ukraine, India doubled down on its purchases. Russian oil currently accounts for almost 20% of India's annual crude imports, a significant increase from just 2% in 2021, Reuters reported. Oil prices were extremely volatile at the start of the Ukraine war in February last year, spiking to $100 for the first time since 2014 . But India has continued to buy cheap Russian oil since and continues trading with the country despite global sanctions on the Kremlin.

""India has become very close to the West in the last five to 10 years, but it understands that it cannot simply detach from Russia,"" Amit Ranjan, research fellow at the NUS Institute of South Asian Studies said. ""Russia is an old friend of India, and India understands the importance of the relationship … Oil is an important piece of that relationship,"" Ranjan said.

Technology: Diversifying from China

Partnerships in technology will be also be top on the agenda for Modi. ""I think the technology issues have become so critically important, as we see China making advancements and hear about China's advancements with AI,"" according to Curtis. ""In seeing how much China is advancing, the U.S. now understands the importance of really cooperating closely with India and trying to take advantage of the strengths on both sides,"" she said. ""There are so many ways that the two sides can benefit from this increased technology cooperation—not to mention the progress that has been made on semiconductors. This has been a real area of focus for India and the United States, and I see that only growing as we move into the future,"" Curtis added. There will also be a flurry of business meetings with tech leaders. Tesla chief Elon Musk met Modi in New York to discuss the EV company's ambitions in India and the possibility of setting up a manufacturing facilities in the country. Modi is also expected to meet other CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft's Satya Nadella and FedEx's Raj Subramaniam at the White House state dinner on Thursday, sources told CNBC. The growing partnership between India and the U.S. also gives room for the two nations to adopt a ""China plus one"" strategy and push more technology companies to set up operations in India, analysts told CNBC. The U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology was announced in May last year. The iCET initiative aims to ""elevate and expand"" the two countries' technology partnership and defense industrial cooperation, the White House said in January. Pant said it points to the two countries' willingness to work together — both in terms of research and development, and what both governments can do together. In the last six months, more U.S. technology companies have set their eyes on India."
312,https://thesvi.org/reflecting-on-us-india-strategic-partnership-following-modis-visit/,Reflecting On US-India Strategic Partnership Following Modi’s Visit,2023-08-10 06:25:13+00:00,"Listen to this article Listen to this article

The U.S.-India joint statement issued by the White House during Prime Minister Narendra Mod’s visit to the United States outlines the high-level diplomatic engagement of India. It reflects areas of mutual interest, cooperation, and strategic goals, as well as specific commitments that entail with their interest-based strategic alignment and that both states would be bound to fulfill during their course of partnership. The United States and India have affirmed a collaborative mechanism of being among the closest partners in the world, and specifically not allies, to foster a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific.

The language of the joint statement, when analyzed, matters a lot as it differs significantly from the collaborative statements released by the U.S. and its allies, Australia, ROK, and Japan, given the same objective of preserving a rule-based Indo-Pacific order in the Indo-Pacific. The US-India relationship is characterized by a strategic focus on interoperability as partners, with a primary emphasis on issue-based collaboration, as in technology, space and nuclear domains. While both countries work together to enhance capabilities and pursue common objectives, they do not have an integrated deterrence framework which the U.S. has prioritized in its strategy for its security partners in the Asia-Pacific. This distinct approach sets the U.S. policy towards India apart from its defense partners and allies in the region, as traditional alliances prioritize collective defense and integrated deterrence. Instead, the US-India partnership prioritizes issue-specific cooperation, particularly in advancing clean energy initiative to justify nuclear power plants deals, space exploration and technology sale. By capitalizing on bilateral strengths and priorities, this relationship carves out a specialized niche in the U.S. regional engagement, demonstrating a pragmatic and tailored approach to strategic cooperation.

The preamble of the statement concludes by featuring on ‘development of human enterprise’ as the focus of the partnership and the bonds of family and friends have been prioritized as their mode of carrying out the relationship. Notably, PM Modi’s delegation was composed of the Indian business community and was publicized by the Indian business advocacy group, the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) to the American businessmen. Together, these elements indicate a focus on the Indian economy, human resource, and the soft-power potential that can of benefit to American capitalists and as an alternate to China in the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region. Moreover, the emphasis on human rights, democracy, freedom, and rule of law indicates a commitment to creating an enabling environment for economic interests.

Interestingly, the reactors and fighter jet engines deal strategically supplements the American economy by effectively leveraging India’s economic potential to establish a lucrative market. One of the reasons behind the India-U.S. nuclear deal was that the American nuclear industry was going bankrupt. Therefore, the U.S. considered India as an emerging market for power reactors. This provided India with an NSG waiver and a de-facto recognition of India’s nuclear programme as a nuclear weapon state outside the NPT with none of the obligations of the NPT signatories. However, the co-production of advanced defense systems and India’s clean energy market would be a significant add up to the Indian economy.

The U.S. strategic approach to partner with India aims at containing China’s influence by leveraging India’s soft power, economy, and technological capabilities. The focus lies in utilizing India’s economic strength to bolster its technological advancements, positioning it as a viable alternative to China in key sectors such as telecommunications, resilient supply chains, and global digital inclusion, particularly in the context of 5G/6G technologies. This strategic initiative aims to tap into India’s soft power influence, leveraging its cultural and diplomatic assets to enhance its standing in the international arena. Similarly, India also seeks to position itself as a viable and attractive partner for global stakeholders, thereby presenting an alternative option to China. Strengthening India’s capabilities in these areas enables it to offer competitive solutions and services, potentially attracting businesses and governments seeking to diversify their partnerships and reduce dependence on China.

Likewise, the space cooperation between India and the U.S. serves two distinct purposes. Firstly, for India, it aligns with its objective of bolstering its space economy. Secondly, for the United States, it serves the purpose of establishing proximity to China, while simultaneously strengthening India’s already capable potential as a space power. The United States recognition of China’s space capabilities as a threat to the U.S and NATO underscores the strategic significance of this cooperative partnership. The timing of India signing the Artemis accords holds significance, as it presents a non-binding set of practical guidelines for space economy and lunar exploration. Herein, India stands to gain without bearing significant risks. Additionally, as space technology has historically been dual-use, the spillover effect into defense capabilities in space is expected to be substantial.

The reliability of the US-India relationship depends on India’s alignment with and service to the U.S. interests. The characteristic of South Asia as a grey zone is already a concern for the U.S., leading to a cautious approach in collaboration with India to safeguard critical technology, defense, and nuclear power interests. The limitations of the Indo-U.S. partnership are evident in defense cooperation, with a focus on technological assembling rather than transfer, to retain US control over sensitive technologies. Overall, the US-India relationship operates within a cautious framework to safeguard mutual interests in critical domains.

Hence, the joint statement signifies a significant milestone in US-India relations, emphasizing a “give-and-take” framework. The partnership aims to leverage India’s economic potential, human resources, and global diplomatic influence to benefit the US economically and strategically, given India’s proximity to China. While the statement indicates a shift towards an India-centric approach, it raises concerns about a potential arms race, and disruption in the region’s status quo, leading to increased competition at regional level. Lastly, the joint statement also reflects a complex dynamic with broader implications for South Asia by exacerbating technological disparity in the region.

The Prime Minister will depart Delhi on the night of September 6 and return late in the evening on September 7.

Describing the ASEAN-India Summit as ‘special’, Saurabh Kumar, Secretary (East) MEA, informed that the summit will be the first one after the elevation of the India-ASEAN relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which happened last year. Further, the Ministry of External Affairs also said that PM Modi will review the progress in ASEAN-India relations and provide them with further direction.

This year, the chair of ASEAN is Indonesia, and the theme of the chairship is ‘ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth’. It is pertinent to note that last year, India and ASEAN celebrated the 30th anniversary of their partnership, and a number of events and activities were organized.

The East Asia Summit, of which India is a founding member, is the foremost of the ASEAN-centered mechanisms in the Indo-Pacific. It has played an instrumental role in providing a platform for dialogue and discussion on matters of strategic importance to the region. The East Asia summit brings together, at the leadership level, ASEAN members and eight dialogue partners, which are Australia, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Russia, and the United States.

""At the forthcoming East Asia Summit, PM Modi and other leaders will discuss ways to further strengthen the EAS mechanism as well as exchange views on matters of regional and international interest,"" informed Saurabh Kumar, Secretary (East) MEA.

The Indian ambassador to ASEAN, Jayant Khobragade, highlighted that the visit shows how India gives importance to this region and to ASEAN's centrality. ""You have rightly pointed out that the PM of India is coming here despite the G20 Summit being held right after a day. This shows the kind of importance that we give to this region,"" said Ambassador Khobragade. Further, he added that India has always given importance to ASEAN centrality, which is a complex of several things - connectivity, trade, investment, and people-to-people contact, among others.

India's relations with ASEAN - A central pillar of its Act East policy

While giving details about the growing ASEAN-India relations, Saurabh Kumar, Secretary (East) MEA, said that India’s focus has been on enhancing comprehensive connectivity with ASEAN in all aspects, including physical, digital, economic, and people-to-people. Notably, earlier this year, PM Modi, along with his Singapore counterpart, launched the real-time cross-border payment link between UPI and Singapore's Pay Now.

In May of this year, India and ASEAN organised their first maritime exercise. The first ASEAN-India Defense Ministers’ meeting was held in November last year. In 2022–23, India and ASEAN registered a bilateral trade of US $131.5 billion. It accounted for over 11% of India's trade for the year and was the second highest after India-EU trade."

The trip is taking place at a time when U.S.-Indian ties are growing more complicated, particularly as Modi has refused to directly condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There are also questions about what values the two countries share as Modi leans into ethnonationalist politics and India’s democratic institutions continue to decay. Despite these tensions, New Delhi remains a key U.S. ally in a region that is growing strategically more important as the competition between the United States and China intensifies. Foreign Affairs’ editors have selected some of the magazine’s best coverage of this complicated relationship—as Washington and New Delhi consider where the partnership may go from here."
315,https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/india/data.html,Japan-India Relations (Basic Data),,"Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori’s visit to India in August 2000 provided the momentum to strengthen the Japan-India relationship. Mr. Mori and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee decided the establishment of ""Global Partnership between Japan and India"". Since Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi’s visit to India in April 2005, Japan-India annual summit meetings have been held in respective capitals. When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Japan in December 2006, Japan-India relationship was elevated to the ""Global and Strategic Partnership"". In September 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid an official visit to Japan and had a summit meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. They concurred to upgrade the bilateral relationship to “Special Strategic and Global Partnership.” In December 2015, Prime Minister Abe paid an official visit to India and had a summit meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The two Prime Ministers resolved to transform the Japan-India Special Strategic and Global Partnership into a deep, broad-based and action-oriented partnership, which reflects a broad convergence of their long-term political, economic and strategic goals. They announced “Japan and India Vision 2025 Special Strategic and Global Partnership Working Together for Peace and Prosperity of the Indo-Pacific Region and the World”, a joint statement that would serve as a guide post for the “new era in Japan-India relations.”

In November 2016, Prime Minister Modi paid an official visit to Japan and had a summit meeting with Prime Minister Abe. In the Japan-India Vision Statement issued during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Japan in October 2018, two leaders reiterated their unwavering commitment to working together towards a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”.

In September 2021, Prime Minister Suga, who was visiting Washington D.C. for the Second Japan-Australia-India-U.S. Summit Meeting, held a summit meeting with Prime Minister Modi. In October 2021, Prime Minister Kishida held a summit telephone talk with Prime Minister Modi, soon after Prime Minister Kishida’s taking office. In March 2022, Prime Minister Kishida visited India for the first time in four and a half years as Prime Minister of Japan. In May 2022, Prime Minister Modi visited Japan for the Japan-Australia-India-U.S. Summit Meeting held in Japan. Prime Minister Modi visited Japan again for attending the state funeral for former Prime Minister Abe. In March and September 2023, Prime Minister Kishida visited India, and in May 2023, Prime Minister Modi visited Japan, and held summit meetings. 2023 is the year in which the two nations hold presidencies of the G7 and G20 respectively. The two leaders confirmed their commitment to work together on various issues in the international community and concurred to further develop Japan-India relations”."

The event in question exerted a notable influence on India’s position in the global arena, drawing attention to its identity as both a strategic and economic power within the broader Indo-Pacific region. The recent visit of Prime Minister Modi showcased various aspects of India’s cultural heritage, diplomatic prowess, and growing influence on the global stage. Additionally, the trip witnessed the forging of significant defence and semiconductor production agreements, underscoring India’s commitment to strengthening international partnerships and fostering technological advancements. These deals hold great importance in terms of fostering economic cooperation and enhancing bilateral relations between India and the United States. The aforementioned agreements also serve to enhance India’s defence capabilities and reinforce its reputation as a reliable partner in the realm of advanced technology. The primary objective of this partnership is to enhance the security infrastructure of India and foster closer military cooperation between India and the United States. The observed cooperation between the two nations signifies a notable increase in their reciprocal confidence and convergence of interests in upholding stability within the region and effectively addressing shared security challenges.



The present issue brief aims to analyse the importance of Prime Minister Modi’s visit in bolstering the already established Indo-U.S. partnership across various domains, including but not limited to the Indo-Pacific strategy, defence cooperation, telecommunications, space, semiconductors, clean energy, and trade. Furthermore, this brief also explores the potential for future collaboration between the two nations in these areas.

317,https://www.csis.org/analysis/modis-state-visit-washington-renewed-momentum-us-india-ties,Modi’s State Visit to Washington: Renewed Momentum in U.S.-India Ties,2023-06-30 12:00:00,"Indian prime minister Narendra Modi was in Washington, D.C. from June 21 to 23 for his first state visit, where he engaged with various U.S. stakeholders. The joint statement released on June 22 contains a multitude of announcements aimed at furthering U.S.-India cooperation in defense, critical technologies, space, clean energy, and intercultural ties.

The lead-up to the visit was contentious—members of Congress and human rights groups demanded that the Biden administration use the visit to highlight growing concerns about India’s track record on a range of social issues. Other groups saw the visit as an opportunity to push India to take a harder stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, in the end, the Biden administration chose to focus—publicly—on areas of cooperation.

Q1: There were dozens of announcements during the visit. Which ones stand out and why?

A1: After a decades-long divide, building trust remains a critical element in accelerating U.S.-India strategic cooperation. While relations have steadily improved over the past two decades, progress has been erratic due to India’s lingering concerns about embracing the United States unequivocally.

First, India wants to avoid becoming entangled in U.S.-led confrontations in parts of the world where it has nominal interests. Second, India wants to see that the “Indo-Pacific” has more emphasis on security concerns in the Indian Ocean region and the South Asian landmass. Third, India wants access to sensitive defense technologies that can help the nation become self-sufficient in producing high-end defense equipment.

The United States and India made notable progress in all three fronts. First, on global tensions, the Biden administration chose to engage India on critical strategic matters despite its differing views over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

On the second point—Indian Ocean—both countries agreed to initiate an Indian Ocean Dialogue later this year. Other steps, such as the sale of Sea Guardian drones and increasing cooperation on maritime domain awareness, will provide India the tools to contribute to regional security.

Third, on technology transfer, the two countries had a range of announcements. General Electric entered an agreement with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to manufacture F-414 jet fighter engines to support India’s combat aircraft manufacturing abilities. Additionally, a collaborative platform, “INDUS-X,” was created to bring together stakeholders such as policymakers, academics, researchers, and startups from both countries. While startup programs may take longer to gestate, jointly developing strategic technologies from inception should be easier than negotiating for the less-than-market-rate transfer of mature technologies from the United States’ private sector.

Q2: What were the biggest surprises from the visit?

A2: There was tremendous anticipation over announcements related to the initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), which was jointly launched in January 2023 to further defense and strategic partnership. As expected, there were several announcements to support technology transfers, and joint innovation in critical technologies such as 6G development, space cooperation, and mineral supply chains.

However, there were also some unexpected pleasant surprises. Commercial policy engagements between U.S. and Indian policymakers, bilaterally and at multilateral forums like the World Trade Organization (WTO), have typically been mired with tensions and have had few positive outcomes. To redress this, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced the agreed-upon termination of six pending WTO disputes between the nations, on the sidelines of the state visit.

Another important commercial announcement is the agreement to start a dialogue related to government procurement. Restrictions on government procurement had led to a deterioration in commercial relations earlier.

The two governments also announced concrete steps to improve people-to-people ties. The United States secured approval to establish new consulates in the Indian cities of Ahmedabad and Bengaluru. India announced it would open a new consulate in Seattle by year end and secured the approval to establish two additional new consulates in the United States. The United States also announced a relaxation of the renewal process for holders of H-1B and L1 visas. This is a tremendous step for the technology services firms that comprise an important backbone for U.S.-India commercial ties.

Q3: There were plenty of “transactions” during the visit. Should the United States seek balance in terms of give and take with India?

A3: The United States has a significantly larger economy, a more advanced defense sector, and a larger stake—at least today—in maintaining global security. So, the United States should generally be willing to give more than it expects in return. On the other hand, India brings access to a large and developing market, as well as its ability to manage Chinese influence in the region. Both elements are crucial for U.S. commercial and defense interests.

Q4: What are the more tangible ways India is supporting U.S. interests?

A4: India is finding concrete ways to contribute to regional security. India provided vital support to prodemocratic forces in Maldives and Sri Lanka in recent years that helped eject pro-China leaders. Indian shipyards have started to offer basic repair services to U.S. Navy vessels in the Indian Ocean. The Indian Air Force has led humanitarian evacuations during a range of crises in the Middle East. The United States is India’s largest partner for military exercises, and an increasingly large supplier of vital defense equipment. To the extent that India continues to open foreign investment and removed trade barriers, it may also become a viable alternative to U.S. companies seeking to pivot from China and diversify supply chains.

Q5: Where is the bilateral agenda the weakest? How can the two sides improve relations?

A5: Both nations still have a difficult time making meaningful progress on commercial policy issues. The resolution of the WTO disputes is helpful. However, there is no agreement or framework for what the future of our commercial relationship should look like, much less any concrete action to bring this vision forward. The United States would do well to copy the work the Australian government did in 2018 with the release of the India Economic Strategy. The private sector on both sides should be a meaningful part of this conversation.

Commercial ties remain robust, with around $130 billion in annual goods trade and healthy foreign investment flows in both directions. Relaxing policy impediments, such as U.S. visa restrictions and trade barriers, as well as trade and investment barriers in India, will help cement the commercial relationship. Improved business linkages will provide much-needed ballast during periods when we are misfiring on strategic cooperation.

There is also much potential for headway on bilateral subnational cooperation. New consulates are important, but beyond that, state- and city-level leaders in both nations are finding new ways to decarbonize their local economies, provide basic services to citizens, and further social and economic development through regional partnerships.

Q6: Why is the Biden administration engaging India so deeply when India will not condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine?

A6: If the invasion went worse for Ukraine, or was destabilizing the region, the Biden administration might have chosen to reduce the intensity of engagement with India. But the United States has found that nominal support to Ukraine, with allies and partners, has been sufficient to blunt the Russian offensive. India’s voice or vote would not have played a significant role in how Russia has prosecuted the fight. India has also been able to assuage some concerns by actively calling for peaceful resolution at different international forums. India’s relations with the key players might also become useful to help build an eventual roadmap for ending the conflict.

While U.S. officials would love for India’s position on the Russian invasion to continue to strengthen, there is a unique opportunity to widen and deepen cooperation, and they have chosen to take advantage.

Russia’s ineffective military campaign has also underscored the fact that China presents the only real state-led threat to global security, and the United States and India are steadily deepening their partnership bilaterally and through forums like the Quad to improve the likelihood of peace and tranquility in the region. So long as this strategic relationship continues to grow, it is unlikely that a U.S. administration will press India to take a hard line on Russia.

Q7: Human rights was expected to be a big topic, yet was relegated to the sidelines. How does the Biden administration balance these concerns with a forward-looking agenda?

A7: It is unlikely that direct public statements by Biden administration leaders on concerns about India’s recent human rights record would yield much benefit. More likely, India would reduce its engagement with the United States. U.S. administrations may choose differently in the future, but for now, it is clear the United States sees enough upside in its relationship with India to avoid triggering a massive disruption.

These issues were a key topic of conversation in private meetings. And, of course, both the president and vice president publicly discussed the importance of tolerance, freedom of expression, and other values which have been foundational for both nations.

318,https://www.ankasam.org/new-era-in-india-us-relations/?lang=en,New Era in India-US Relations? — ANKASAM,2023-07-24 14:50:10+00:00,"United States President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met on June 22, 2023, in Washington. Modi’s visit to Washington is significant in many aspects. Firstly, it holds symbolic importance as it is Modi’s first official visit to the United States since 2009.[1]

Furthermore, it has been a strategic visit aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation. The statements of both leaders, along with defense and trade agreements, signify the beginning of a new phase in the bilateral relationship. During the meeting, Biden used the expressions “two great nations, two great friends, and two great powers,” while Modi stated that “regional stability has become one of the core concerns of our partnership.”[2] Agreements were reached between the two parties on semiconductors, critical minerals, technology, space cooperation, and defense collaboration.

The visit in question has also resolved some disputes within the framework of the World Trade Organization, with India lifting certain tariffs on US goods. It is known that the two countries have close ties in terms of trade partnership, making every step in this regard crucial. Additionally, India has agreed to join the US-led Artemis Accords in space exploration and to collaborate with NASA on a joint mission to the International Space Station in 2024.[3] It is worth mentioning that India joined the 14-member Indo-Pacific Economic Framework led by the US in May 2023.

As a result, Modi’s visit, due to its content and areas of cooperation, has led to the use of the discourse of a “new era” and a “turning point” in the bilateral relations between the two countries. Other agreements reached between the parties can be listed as follows:[4]

Through an agreement with Hindustan Aeronautics, General Electric has been allowed to produce jet engines in India to provide power to Indian military aircraft.

Under a maritime agreement, US Navy ships can dock at Indian shipyards for repairs, and India will procure armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian unmanned aerial vehicles from the US.

The US company Micron Technology is planning to build a $2.7 billion semiconductor testing and packaging unit in Gujarat.

The process of obtaining and renewing US visas for skilled Indian workers will be facilitated.

The Critical and Emerging Technology Partnership Agreement will facilitate collaboration between US and Indian companies and universities in various sectors, including information technology, space, defense, artificial intelligence, education, and healthcare.

It should be noted that the US needs India in the global struggle against China. The high-level reception and attention given to Modi in Washington are a reflection of this. In fact, a state dinner was held in Modi’s honor, a gesture that was previously reserved for leaders of France and South Korea. This indicates the desire of the White House to elevate its relations with the New Delhi government to higher levels, making the visit interesting and significant.

In this context, we can see an example of the strategic moves of the US in global politics. India’s closer ties with Russia and its purchase of the S-400 air defense system have prompted the Biden administration to take action in strengthening ties with New Delhi.

It is important to emphasize that India’s actions and policy preferences are shaped within the framework of a multifaceted foreign policy approach. New Delhi not only aligns with Washington but also implements strategies in response to global developments.

In pursuing its goals of maintaining an independent foreign policy and strategic autonomy, India’s steps sometimes lead to disagreements with the US. For example, New Delhi has been establishing various partnerships and enhancing dialogue with Moscow, particularly since the start of the conflict in Ukraine. The two countries have also elevated their energy cooperation to a significant level during this process. Therefore, while the Biden administration may desire a India that stands by its side, Modi continues to take steps in line with a multifaceted foreign policy strategy.

Despite all the challenges, the said visit will have a positive impact on the New Delhi-Washington relations. The agreements reached during the visit also indicate this. Additionally, regional and global developments show that the China factor will continue to be a key dynamic in shaping US-India relations.

Finally, besides its global implications, the visit can also be seen as having significance for the internal politics of both countries. The year 2024 will be marked by election processes in both nations. Therefore, Modi’s visit and the agreements reached between the two sides will also influence public opinion in their respective countries.

In conclusion, Modi’s visit is important in terms of highlighting the priorities of the US, the strategy of India, and the policies of both countries. Moreover, the visit has revealed that a new era in India-US relations is about to begin.

“Two great nations, two great friends, and two great powers. Cheers,"" Biden told Modi in a toast at a state dinner. Modi said in reply: “You are soft spoken, but when it comes to action, you are very strong.”

Though the countries aren't formal allies and India has long relished its independence, Washington wants Delhi to be a strategic counterweight to China.

While neither leader criticised Beijing directly in official statements, they alluded to the Xi Jinping-led government.

""The dark clouds of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo Pacific,"" Modi told Congress. ""The stability of the region has become one of the central concerns of our partnership.""

After Biden and Modi spoke privately for more than two hours, a joint statement included a warning of rising tensions and destabilizing actions in the East and South China Sea and stressed the importance of international law and freedom of navigation.

""The challenges and opportunities facing the world in this century require that India and the United States work and lead together, and we are,"" Biden said as he welcomed Modi to the White House.

The state dinner, held in a large, elaborately erected tent on the White House South Lawn, featured a number of Silicon Valley executives on the guest list, including Apple's Tim Cook, 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, among others.

With the slightly Indian-accented dinner, the Bidens followed a White House tradition of serving guests from abroad food that has faint echoes of home with a strong American bent.

Modi is seeking to raise the status that India, the world's most populous country at 1.4 billion and fifth-largest economy, has on the world stage as a manufacturing and diplomatic powerhouse while navigating strained ties with China.

His participation in a White House press conference itself was a reflection of contrasting political traditions, marking the first time Modi has taken questions in such a format in his nine-year tenure.

He took one question apiece from an American and an Indian journalist selected in advance, and dismissed criticism about India's human rights record.

Washington has been frustrated by India's close ties with Russia while Moscow wages war in Ukraine. Modi avoided direct mention of Russia, but told lawmakers the conflict was ""causing great pain in the region. Since it involves major powers, the outcomes are severe.""

Boycotts and welcome crowds

Modi's visit was not without controversy. The speech to Congress, normally a bipartisan affirmation of a visiting leader from an allied nation, was boycotted by some liberal lawmakers, who cited the Modi government's treatment of India's Muslim minority.

""I encourage my colleagues who stand for pluralism, tolerance and freedom of the press to join me in doing the same,"" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Wednesday.

Modi's speech to the Congress also drew a crowd of on-lookers who chanted ""Modi, Modi"" at applause lines.

As some 7,000 well-wishers gathered for a colorful opening ceremony at the White House, a far smaller group of demonstrators gathered blocks away to protest the Biden administration's coziness with Modi, who leads the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.

Asked by a US reporter about what steps he would take to improve the rights of Muslims and other minorities, Modi said ""there's absolutely no space for discrimination"" in India.

Biden told reporters he and Modi had a straightforward discussion about democratic values.

New US-India deals

The two countries announced agreements on semiconductors, critical minerals, technology, space cooperation and defense cooperation and sales.

Some are aimed at diversifying supply chains to reduce dependence on China. Others are aimed at cornering the market in advanced technologies that may feature on the battlefields of the future.

They also ended disputes at the World Trade Organisation, and India removed some tariffs on US goods.

The United States is India's largest trading partner but the US has much larger trading relationships with China, the EU, and North American neighbors.

Biden and Modi signed off on a deal to allow General Electric to produce jet engines in India to power Indian military aircraft, through an agreement with Hindustan Aeronautics.

US Navy ships in the region will be able to stop in Indian shipyards for repairs under a maritime agreement, and India will procure US-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.

US chipmaker Micron Technology plans a $2.7 billion semiconductor testing and packaging unit, to be built in Modi's home state of Gujarat.

The US will also make it easier for skilled Indian workers to get and renew US visas.

India also agreed to join the US-led Artemis Accords on space exploration and to work with NASA on a joint mission to the International Space Station in 2024.

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

The White House will roll out the red carpet this week for a crucial Asian ally. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet President Biden on Thursday, with a lavish state dinner also on the schedule. That same day, Modi will address a joint session of Congress. The Biden administration has made deepening ties with India a top foreign policy priority as it hopes to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Seema Sirohi is a columnist for The Economic Times, one of India's most influential newspapers, and author of the book ""Friends With Benefits: The India-U.S. Story."" She joins us now to discuss the trip. Welcome.

SEEMA SIROHI: Nice to be with you.

RASCOE: The White House is pulling out all the stops for Prime Minister Modi. Why is this relationship so important to the U.S.?

SIROHI: Well, the U.S. has identified China as a competitor, as a rival. So India has become very important for U.S.'s Indo-Pacific policy because the U.S. wants to retain its No. 1 position in the region. India, which has China on its border, is in a very sort of border standoff situation for the past two years. So the interests of both India and the United States have converged on countering China, to put it very simply. And then there are many, many other reasons why the U.S. thinks of India as a major partner. India needs the U.S. for its own development. The U.S. needs the talent from India. As you might know, there are almost 200,000 Indian students in the United States, and Indian Americans are increasingly very, very important, both politically as well as in the economic arena.

RASCOE: And so what will Prime Minister Modi want from President Biden during this visit? Like, what are his priorities?

SIROHI: So for India, technology transfer is a top priority. Becoming part of the supply chains is another very big priority. Both countries trust each other, and they are building what they call resilient supply chains so that the world will not be dependent on just one factory that is China. There is a deal that might be signed for one of the major U.S. companies to invest in trying to create a semiconductor ecosystem in India. Another big deal that is likely to be announced is for the U.S. General Electric to co-produce its military jet engines in India. And that's a huge step forward 'cause India has long wanted technology transfer. In the past things have stalled because the U.S. hasn't been so amenable to that.

RASCOE: And so, I mean, you've been covering this relationship for decades, so how has it changed over the years?

SIROHI: What I can tell you is when I first came to Washington, India was not an important partner for the United States. Everything was about China and Pakistan, both of which are rivals of India. Then President George W. Bush changed dramatically the U.S. policy towards India because Bush's idea was why aren't the two democracies better friends? So India and the U.S. signed a major nuclear deal under which India was recognized de facto as a nuclear weapons power. Now people are comparing that transformative moment to today.

RASCOE: Prime Minister Modi has been accused of eroding Indian democracy and suppressing criticism of his ruling party. Do you think any of that will be raised this week?

SIROHI: It won't be raised in public, I would say - not by the administration, not at the White House. But you might see some comments from congressmen and senators on Capitol Hill. But right now, realism in terms of geopolitics tops human rights concerns, to put it very bluntly. Countering China is very important for the United States at this moment, and getting as many allies and partners in line on the American side is the main goal.

RASCOE: That's Seema Sirohi, a newspaper columnist and author of ""Friends With Benefits: The India-U.S. Story."" Thank you so much for being with us.

SIROHI: Thank you.

But the US and India are united by shared strategic interests, beginning with the maintenance of a rules-based Indo-Pacific free of coercion.

NEW DELHI – No bilateral relationship has deepened and strengthened more rapidly over the last two decades than the one between the United States and India. In fact, Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to the US will be his eighth as India’s prime minister, and his second since US President Joe Biden took office. The US has at least as much to gain from the growing closeness as India does.

India just overtook China in population size, and although its economy remains smaller, it is growing faster. In fact, India is now the world’s fastest-growing major economy, with GDP having already surpassed that of the United Kingdom and on track to overtake that of Germany. India thus represents a major export market for the US, including for weapons.

But commercial opportunities are just the beginning. In an era of sharpening geopolitical competition, the US is seeking partners to help it counter the growing influence – and assertiveness – of China (and its increasingly close ally Russia). India is an obvious partner for its fellow democracies in the West, though what it really represents is a critical “swing state” in the struggle to shape the future of the Indo-Pacific and the world order more broadly. The US cannot afford for it to swing toward the emerging Russia-China alliance.

Consider America’s quest to bolster supply-chain resilience through so-called friend-shoring. As Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has explained, India is among the “trusted trading partners” with which the US is “proactively deepening economic integration,” as it attempts to diversify its trade “away from countries that present geopolitical and security risks” to its supply chain.

India is also integral to maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. Its military standoff with China – now entering its 38th month – is a case in point. By refusing to back down, India is openly challenging Chinese expansionism, while making it more difficult for China to make a move on Taiwan. Biden has not commented on the confrontation, but he is certainly paying attention. It is telling that both Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan visited New Delhi this month.

Already, India holds more military exercises with the US than any other power, and as of 2020, it had signed all four of the “foundational” agreements that the US maintains with all its allies. This means that the two countries, among other things, provide reciprocal access to each other’s military facilities and share geospatial data from airborne and satellite sensors. Meanwhile, India’s involvement in the Quad – along with the US, Australia, and Japan – has lent the grouping much-needed strategic heft.

Fortifying the strategic relationship with India is one of the rare issues eliciting bipartisan consensus in the US. The latest invitation to Modi to address the US Congress – he is the first Indian leader to do so twice – came from Democratic and Republican leaders alike.

Nonetheless, plenty of skeptics in the West believe that US efforts to cement strategic ties with India will disappoint. For example, one commentator recently declared that India will never be an ally of the US, and another argued that treating India as a key partner will not help the US in its geopolitical competition with China.

A key concern is India’s commitment to retaining its strategic independence. While India has rarely mentioned non-alignment since Modi came to power, in practice, it has been multi-aligned. As it has deepened its partnerships with democratic powers, it has also maintained its traditionally close relationship with Russia.

But India’s relationships with the US and Russia seem to be moving in opposite directions. India is building a broad and multifaceted partnership with the US – covering everything from cooperation on human spaceflight to the construction of resilient semiconductor supply chains – whereas its relationship with Russia now seems limited almost exclusively to defense and energy.

Nonetheless, India is not prepared to shun Russia, as the West has since the invasion of Ukraine, not least because India still views Russia as a valuable counterweight to China. In India’s view, China and Russia are not natural allies at all, but natural competitors that have been forced together by US policy. A Sino-Russian strategic axis serves neither India’s nor America’s interests, yet, much to India’s frustration, the US appears to have little interest in rethinking its policy.

This is not the only area where India believes that US policy undermines Indian security interests. India also takes issue with America’s insistence on maintaining severe sanctions on Myanmar and Iran, while coddling Pakistan, where mass arrests, disappearances, and torture have become the norm. The US is now threatening visa sanctions against officials of Bangladesh’s secular government – which is locked in a battle against Islamist forces – if it believes they are undermining elections that are due early next year.

The US is not accustomed to being challenged by its partners. Its traditional, Cold War-style alliances position the US as the “hub” and its allies as the “spokes.” But this will never work with India. As the White House’s Asia policy czar, Kurt Campbell, has acknowledged, “India has a unique strategic character,” and “a desire to be an independent, powerful state.” Far from a US client, India “will be another great power.”

Campbell is right. But that does not mean that the skeptics are also right. While a traditional treaty-based alliance with India would not work, the kind of soft alliance the US is pursuing, which requires no pact but does include, as Campbell also underlined, “people-to-people ties” and cooperation on “technology and the like,” can benefit both sides.

The US and India are united by shared strategic interests, not least in maintaining a rules-based Indo-Pacific free of coercion. As long as China remains on its current course, so will the Indo-American relationship."
324,https://www.nbr.org/publication/modis-visit-to-the-united-states-a-turning-point-for-the-u-s-india-relationship/,Modi's Visit to the United States A Turning Point for the U.S.-India Relationship?,,"What do you see as the significance of Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the United States?

I think that in some ways this particular visit could be a turning point in the India-U.S. relationship. We’ve had several turning points in the relationship. We had India’s economic reforms beginning in 1991–92, the Clinton visit in 2000, and the Bush efforts last decade to deal with the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) on high-tech, nuclear, and space issues.

Now we have a new Indian prime minister coming forward with a set of initiatives that are important for the long-term future of India, and there are ways in which the United States can make a major contribution to that vision. This visit can also open the door for the United States to become a greater part of cooperative arrangements on the Indian scene. This doesn’t mean invading Indian domestic political life, but it does mean becoming a partner with India on a number of activities and ideas that are primarily economic but not exclusively so. It also invites us to have a closer relationship and develop a strategic concept of how we deal with the region and the world.

What is the strategic context that framed the preparations for this visit?

The context is, of course, complicated and complex. On the Indian side, there is a deep concern that the U.S.-Pakistan relationship still remains a prominent determiner of the U.S.-Indian relationship, however exaggerated that might be. On the American side, the concern is that India hasn’t grown in the way that we had hoped and that there are still reservations about doing business in India, especially because of some of the uncertainties during the last Congress government. There are still “hangovers” on both sides: on Prime Minister Modi’s side because of the denial of an American visa for many years and concerns about that issue; on the U.S. side, due to India’s failure to deal with the question of nuclear liability, which would have opened up the advantages the United States thought it had created by starting down a new road with India on nuclear cooperation, but that have not materialized.

The challenge for developing a bilateral strategy will be whether this is a relationship that is characterized more by Modi’s serious interests in developing the Indian economy, or whether this will be a strategic relationship that attempts to deal with foreign policy and security questions as the preeminent interest. It is very clear that Modi will be coming with a very strong sense of carrying on the “Gujarat plan” for economic development and will seek to find ways to interest the American business community much more in working with India. To do that he will also have to convey to the American business community a very strong sense of commitment that India really is prepared to find ways to open the door.

How do you see the prime minister looking to approach these issues?

The sense I have is that his inclination will be to be practical and to work with a number of key firms as a start-up for the relationship. Then, he will take what works and pluralize it, rather than trying to create some kind of institutional construct or spell out some grand communiqué at the outset that can describe it all and see that as the way to move ahead. This is preeminently practical because it deals with some of the obstacles in a concrete and focused way, including some of the bureaucratic obstacles. That’s my sense of the strategy without knowing Modi but being aware of his interests from people I’ve talked to who are close to him and who have a sense of how he would proceed.

My feeling is that Modi will want to ratify with the United States a sense of strong cooperation in the area in which he is most interested: domestic economic development. The United States itself may, as a result, also be able to interest Modi in opening the door on some of the stuck questions that are still out there: whether it is the nuclear relationship or more cooperation in some of the broader multilateral trade arrangements where differences between the United States and India have led to a certain amount of “scratchiness” and lack of progress.

Each side has an interest in a set of relationships that are primarily denominated by India’s very strong interest under Modi in rapid change based on economic growth. The United States should be in a very strong position to support that, because in fact doing business in India for the United States opens up new opportunities that can be very significant. Having worked for the Boeing Company for a number of years and continued my relationship there, I find that is a good example of how a large American firm can work in the vast Indian market. On a high-tech front, Boeing enjoys the benefits of increased sales, particularly of commercial aircraft but also of military equipment, and at the same time works with Indian suppliers on everything from software to aircraft parts. This produces a mutually beneficial relationship as well, not only in pure business terms but also in opening up opportunities for future cooperation and mutual confidence.

You have mentioned that on the U.S. side, there is great interest doing business in India, and Modi has made strengthening these ties an important part of his overall economic agenda. What are U.S. companies looking for when it comes to investing in India?

I think there are a wide variety of things, like the protection of proprietary interests related to patent or copyright questions. The opening up of sectors of the Indian economy, whether it is for investing in insurance or in “big box” stores, is very much part of the American interest, but not the end all and be all. My own feeling is that the strongest interests [in investing] are obviously tied to those sectors that can work out the best partnerships. I talked about Boeing, but there are other companies that are also interested in investing in India with Indian partners in everything from the IT sector to the construction sector.

It is also interesting to see how the really important primary question of agriculture, and rural agriculture in India, can be addressed. No Indian government stays in power without paying attention to the 700 million rural Indians who tend to be voters. How can small-unit agriculture and the future of agriculture be linked together in a prosperous way?

In the United States, less than half of one percent of the population produces most of the crops for domestic consumption and export. It is quite different in India, where two-thirds of the population is engaged in beneficial agriculture. How and in what ways can the state system and even the private sector move that ahead? Are there new ways of preventing post-harvest losses? Are there new possibilities for food processing? Are there new opportunities to help the single-family farm move itself from what is essentially a near-barter economy into a monetary economy? How can education in India particularly cater to the future long-term agricultural interests of the bulk of the population? Those are critical questions for how we talk about potential partnerships.

There are also broader questions about the infrastructure and systems needed for healthy investment environments. As Modi has identified, rural electrification is a key priority. Can he put all Indians in touch with electrical current 24 hours a day in a space of four years? Additionally, problems like corruption run fairly deep in India. How can the Indian bureaucracy be paid well enough and be strict enough in maintaining its own standards to be a true servant of the people rather of the rupee?

These are all tremendous challenges. The United States can help on some issues, but many of these questions will be answered by Indians themselves, and then we will need to find a way to be useful in the Indian context rather than try to convert India into an American context, which is unfortunately a big tendency on the part of the United States.

The prime minister’s office has said that it supports an effort to have a national intellectual property rights policy and strategy in place in the coming months. There will also be an effort to hire one thousand new patent examiners to deal with the backlog of cases and related types of initiatives. This suggests, on the one hand, that U.S. companies’ concerns with Indian policies on these particular issues have found some resonance within the prime minister’s office. On the other hand, the announcements were made just three weeks before Modi’s visit, perhaps suggesting a desire to cast a constructive atmosphere. To what extent are visits of this sort catalyzing events that can lead to productive policy changes?

The answer to this question really depends on how serious both sides are. I would think that Prime Minister Modi would be as much motivated by attracting U.S. investment as he is in protecting India’s growing capacity to do its own R&D and its own product development, which would put the whole relationship on a stronger footing.

If there are domestic motivations for some of these changes, beyond purely pleasing foreign investors, they carry with them the domestic controversy around whether Modi is interested only in promoting foreign business or in promoting domestic demand-driven investment in India’s own economy. As a good politician, Modi has to be interested in India, in India’s growth and capacity to move its economy ahead. So this is a potential win-win if the issue is handled well, and my hope is that it will be because a potential win-win has durability rather than merely the kind of Potemkin-like treatment that summits sometimes produce, as new agreements are announced but then discarded once the summit is over.

Are there any obstacles that the United States should be mindful of as it moves forward with the partnership?

Well I think we can begin in the trade area, with the problem that vexes all of South Asia: textiles. If it’s important in Pakistan and Bangladesh, it’s going to be important in India as well. These textiles can find a market in the United States in the form of finished goods or otherwise, which is a sector that has seen a declining American competitive position. Textiles can also be a “gap filler” as India moves up the economic development chain. I think that outcome is very significant and very useful.

The rest of the Indian concerns, I think, center on the general promotion of mutual trade, to the extent we can do so in a manner that is consistent with domestic economic aspirations. I think that on both sides we want to make sure that Indian investment in the United States, in places like Silicon Valley, is the kind of productive, value-added enterprise we would like to see coming over here.

Many of the large-scale Indian firms, and we all know the names, are in themselves major operators in one way or another on the world scene, but are they active enough in the United States? Is the United States welcoming enough? Are there partnerships that are available for those firms to proceed inside our economy, and is that a useful way to begin to look at how and in what way we can promote this greater mutual prosperity? These are all important questions.

Looking at Modi’s visit in a regional context, a number of commentators have highlighted how this trip fits into the prime minister’s larger outreach. Modi recently met with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe during a successful visit to Japan and also met with Chinese president Xi Jinping during the latter’s visit to India. Both meetings are expected to result in major new investments and projects. Should we anticipate any differences in tone or overall expectations for Modi’s visit to the United States?

I think Prime Minister Modi is sending signals. One signal he has sent is the emphasis on domestic economic development. The other signal he has sent is that he is an Asian, and he is beginning to look at South Asia as part of Asia. Traditionally, South Asia, for colonial reasons alone, was never looked at as part of general Asia. Thirdly, he obviously has strategic issues and interests in the region, particularly in China. The balance between China and Japan is an interesting one in part because Modi has developed close personal relationships with Japanese leaders, particularly with Prime Minister Abe. Modi is not neglecting a Chinese interest, which India has carefully nurtured, but it has found it very hard to move the India-China relationship from dead center. Nurturing is basically a process that ought to lead somewhere, and it should lead away from the fact that the status quo is a perpetual albatross around India’s neck. So there are obviously new opportunities with a new prime minister who is prepared to take risks and produce new concepts for how India should work. We in the United States should be happy that Modi’s emphasis is on two of the areas that are very important to us as well—that is, improved Indian relationships with both Japan and China.

A newer and stronger emphasis on Asia, including India, ought to be part of an American foreign policy preoccupation because of the size and strength of Asia, as well as the growing importance of Asia in geography, in economics, in demography, in production, and in competition. The United States should not nitpick India’s relationships with Asia but welcome them and try to understand what India’s priorities and focal points are and where the United States can be supportive.

Is there anything else that you would like to add?

At rock bottom, the United States and India share more common interests than they have divergences. Since the late 1990s, this has been a common theme in successive American administrations; while the importance accorded to India has varied, no administration has left India behind. When I was ambassador in India in 1991–92, it was very clear to me, and I used to say publicly, that for Americans India was an ideal relationship. But India always appeared on the backside of all American globes so that it had a very low standing, yet that standing is going up and will continue to go up.

We’ve had our differences over the years, and a lot of these are normal because they come out of historical differences and different development paths. Our ability to come together more closely in the last decade has set the groundwork for perhaps another push in the direction of closer cooperation. I think it has been important in the military dimension, but the relationship cannot and should not be all military in focus. Closer cooperation should include, I think, a shared interest in the Middle East, which is also off India’s west coast. It should include a shared interest in Southeast Asia. It should include a shared interest in Indian Ocean security and geography, all issues that are close to India. Closer cooperation should clearly include, in my view, India’s historic relationship with Africa as a complement to its strong and growing relationship with Southeast Asia. Together those are four or five areas where we have a natural possibility to understand each other and work together.

The two leaders’ joint statement included support for a university network of ‘Indo-US Global Challenge Institutes’ and backed suggestions of diplomatic missions helping to facilitate branch campuses and other joint higher education projects.



A special



It recommended setting up joint research institutions to tackle global challenges and deepen research collaboration between Indian and US universities. “Faculty across multiple disciplines would convene to design and develop joint research projects,” according to the



International agreements with the United Kingdom, France and Australia “aimed at creating innovation partnerships” could serve as models for future collaborations with the US.



The US National Science Foundation (NSF) already has experience launching similar efforts to create Global Centers with the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada.



Biden and Modi, in their



The joint statement emphasised research partnerships and people-to-people exchanges in areas such as semiconductors, sustainable agriculture, clean energy, health and pandemic preparedness, and emerging technologies.



“It will deepen the strategic partnership between Indian and American universities,” India’s Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said via Twitter on 23 June.



Jagadesh Kumar, chairman of India’s higher education regulatory body, the University Grants Commission (UGC), welcomed the move to establish a joint task force to assist global universities in setting up branch campuses in India. “These are exciting times for higher education,” he said.



Kumar added: “With the foreign university campus regulations being given the final touches by UGC for the announcement soon, we look forward to working with the liaison office of the diplomatic outposts to facilitate establishing foreign university campuses in India.”



Kumar noted that the meeting between Modi and academic leaders in the US will give them a “clear picture of India’s aspirations and potential and help accelerate the collaboration process in the higher education sector”.



The AAU interim report also suggested that embassies in the US and India needed to “build the front doors” to each other’s country. Dedicated liaison offices should assist universities to navigate the “myriad legal hurdles” to establish non-profit academic centres or satellite campuses in-country and assist on the hosting country’s tax and regulatory landscape, it said.



The AAU task force has already been meeting monthly “to determine key focus areas for bilateral research and education cooperation, to identify existing programmes that could provide blueprints for future partnerships, and to formulate strategies on how best to move forward”, according to the AAU.



“This interim report is a key first step in better leveraging the immense potential and resources of India and the United States to further scientific advancement, economic growth and national security for both countries,” said AAU President Barbara R Snyder, inviting feedback to draw up the final report which AAU plans to release later this year.



University leaders and NSF visit



During his 21-24 June visit, Modi met with members of the AAU task force and other US university leaders and visited the US National Science Foundation (NSF), in Alexandria, Virginia. The NSF is an independent federal US agency that supports education and research in the non-medical sciences and is headed by Indian-American Sethuraman Panchanathan.



Speaking at NSF, where he was accompanied by US First Lady Jill Biden, Modi said: “To maintain growth momentum, India and the US need a pipeline of talent. On the one hand, the US has top-class educational institutions and advanced technologies. On the other hand, India has the world’s biggest youth factory. That is why I believe that the India-US partnership will prove to be the engine of sustainable and inclusive global growth.”



The visit also saw the two countries sign defence and technology agreements, including to sell US drones to India and to co-produce fighter jet engines in India, to invest in India’s nascent semiconductor industry and to train Indian astronauts at the US space agency NASA, among many other announcements.



Adrian Mutton, founder and CEO of the Sannam S4 Group, an international business consultancy which helps US and other foreign universities in tie-ups with companies and universities in India and elsewhere, attended some of the events organised around Modi’s visit and highlighted the importance of higher education.



“To have both Prime Minister Modi and [US] Secretary of State [Antony] Blinken directly engaging with university presidents from the US, and the NSF, I think is a game changer,” he said.



“Prime Minister Modi and Secretary Blinken, at the end of a very long week of many announcements in many areas, chose in their remarks to speak specifically about higher education,” Mutton told University World News.



He added: “For the prime minister [Modi] to go and visit NSF as part of his US tour is a very deliberate use of his time. I take that as an excellent sign [that] it [research and higher education] is on his personal radar”.



“It is an enormous statement of intent because once Prime Minister Modi engages, it’s impossible for the [Indian] bureaucracy to avoid that,” said Mutton, noting that in the past higher education discussions tended to be only at the bureaucratic level of senior officials.



“Partnerships between the US and Indian institutions have been slowly building up over the past several years, but what was different with the Modi visit was that it was a message right from the top about how important these sorts of partnerships are,” Rajika Bhandari, co-founder of the recently launched US-based University World News.



“There are India-US bilateral relations on so many fronts, but higher education at that senior policy level is often left out of the conversation because so much of their focus is on science and technology and trade and other sorts of investments,” she noted. “But as we look at investments, we see how critical those research collaborations are in that higher education space. So, higher education needs to be front and centre of these sorts of conversations.”



Dr Uttiyo Raychaudhuri, vice-provost at the University of Denver and also a co-founder of the South Asia-IEN, attended several of the events around Modi’s visit and remarked not only on the scale of the “pomp and show” but also on the turn-out of the highly successful Indian diaspora at the many events.



“There is so much intellectual capital and entrepreneurship capital – the capacity for innovation is incredible,” he said, noting that half a dozen university presidents, many of Indian origin, attended the state dinner at the White House on 22 June.



Raychaudhuri added that these kinds of ‘visuals’ were important for higher education partnerships to rise up the agenda.



Referring to Modi’s visit to NSF, Raychaudhuri told University World News: “A huge focus of the [Indian] government is [on] the next phase of AI-related work. They want to know about quantum [computing], about AI, and they want talent – their own talent that has left their shores – to come back, and also to bring in talent from here in the US and collaborate.”



“Prime Minister Modi made a very pointed statement that he wanted more US students to come to India,” Raychaudhuri added.



Building expertise for hi-tech industries



The AAU interim report on US-India higher education partnerships is closely linked to a special technology initiative on critical and emerging technologies. This was announced during bilateral talks between Biden and Modi in Tokyo in May 2022, based on “shared security interests and aims to grow technological and industrial collaboration between the two nations”, according to the joint statement at the time.



Minister Pradhan referred to the initiative on 24 June in comments on Modi’s US visit. “The recently launched India-US initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) will usher in a new phase of partnership, given the vibrant talent pool in India and the US, particularly in new age technologies and the synergistic research and development centres of excellence in our academic institutes,” he said.



“This formal partnership, with its complementary expertise and incorporation of industry collaboration and startup enablers, will facilitate free flow of ideas, student exchange and joint IPRs [intellectual property rights],” he said.



“This academic partnership will help in developing solutions for a sustainable and secure future. This is a historic moment when two strong nations are joining hands in education and research that is bound to make a global impact in the coming years,” he added.



The AAU interim report recommended the expansion of internship and apprenticeship opportunities for Indian and US undergraduate and graduate students, as well as for post-doctoral researchers, which it said would be critical to meet the objectives of iCET. “This will require a coordinated effort to establish short-term placements in companies and non-governmental organisations for practical training,” it said.



Mutton noted that much of Modi’s visit focused on large corporations, with the US committing to setting up some manufacturing to India as part of its shift away from China. “Within a few years, the manufacturing will be done in India, so it’s [about] the localisation of that expertise. And that is an absolute priority for Prime Minister Modi,” he said.



“India’s perspective is that it has the need and the opportunity to localise a lot of the expertise. I think this is why Prime Minister Modi went to the NSF – to see how India can capitalise on what is an enormous amount of human brain capital in the country.”



Mutton noted that India has recognised that “as part of that entire value chain, a lot of the expertise that feeds into the R&D that then becomes the manufacturing output or the service output or the knowledge output, comes from these university partnerships”.



“India doesn’t tend to produce and own much of its own intellectual property,” he said. “They’re now looking at ways of partnering with international universities to bring that expertise into India and to learn from it and emulate and improve on it,” Mutton said, noting that much of that research would be funded by industry.



“Historically, much of the research collaboration and partnerships that are undertaken between US universities and Indian ones are undertaken by NRIs,” he said, referring to Non-Resident Indians, or Indians abroad. “They are academics that have gone from India to the US and partnered with people they know, or they’ve gone to the US for a while and come back to a university in India and are now reaching out to colleagues in the US.”



What US universities want



Raychaudhuri noted that his email inbox was “flooded” with requests from “all kinds of universities in India – smaller universities, private universities – who want to connect [with us] because of our rankings of excellence in research”.



“On the Indian side, they are seeing this as an opportunity, and they want to collaborate. So, this is a very important juncture when change can happen,” he said. “US universities have a very good opportunity to sit around the table now and make these things happen.”



He said the University of Denver had very little in the way of partnerships in India but is now connecting with the Indian Institute of Management Indore to conduct some research on the urban environment in both countries.



However, he acknowledged that “one of the key things moving forward with the collaborations would be a shared allocation of resources, or at least some sense that there will be ease in resource availability”.



The AAU interim report pointed to funding deficiencies and issues around dividing the costs of research as an area that could hamper tie-ups, as well as regulatory and policy barriers in the US visa system, US export control policies, and the Indian Foreign Contribution Regulation Act which restricts transfers of funds, and structural and cultural issues in the countries’ higher education systems.



“The immense complexity of the combined US and Indian regulatory environments is itself a major barrier to additional collaboration,” it said.



“Even well-resourced institutions have found it difficult to navigate these waters, and those that have are often forced to rely on external consultants to find their way. Those unable to afford such support have chosen not to pursue collaborations,” the report said.



“Without a commitment by both countries to provide significant investments to support new and much larger partnerships, collaborations will continue to remain localised and uncoordinated, with limited impact in furthering each nation’s strategic priorities.”



Nonetheless, there is momentum. Mutton noted that some US universities were at the stage of “formally doing due diligence on what it would take to set up some form of campus”, though not necessarily a multidisciplinary full-fledged branch campus in India.



“A couple of US universities were trying to get announcements in time for Prime Minister Modi’s visit, but there just wasn’t enough time for them to get all of the internal clearances to do that. There are some that want to take ‘first mover advantage’,” he said. “But it’s still going to take time”.



Mutton added that “relatively highly ranked” US universities could make announcements of operations in India by the autumn or earlier. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United States President Joe Biden have put university and technological collaboration between the two countries firmly on the map after Modi’s landmark four-day state visit to the US, which, unusually, emphasised higher education as an important part of the partnership.The two leaders’ joint statement included support for a university network of ‘Indo-US Global Challenge Institutes’ and backed suggestions of diplomatic missions helping to facilitate branch campuses and other joint higher education projects.A special Task Force on Expanding US-India University Partnerships set up earlier this year under the Association of American Universities (AAU), made up of some 71 major research universities in the US, released an interim report on 21 June in advance of the Modi visit.It recommended setting up joint research institutions to tackle global challenges and deepen research collaboration between Indian and US universities. “Faculty across multiple disciplines would convene to design and develop joint research projects,” according to the report International agreements with the United Kingdom, France and Australia “aimed at creating innovation partnerships” could serve as models for future collaborations with the US.The US National Science Foundation (NSF) already has experience launching similar efforts to create Global Centers with the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada.Biden and Modi, in their joint statement on 22 June, referred to the prospect of such a university network as “leveraging the talent and ambition of both our countries”.The joint statement emphasised research partnerships and people-to-people exchanges in areas such as semiconductors, sustainable agriculture, clean energy, health and pandemic preparedness, and emerging technologies.“It will deepen the strategic partnership between Indian and American universities,” India’s Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said via Twitter on 23 June.Jagadesh Kumar, chairman of India’s higher education regulatory body, the University Grants Commission (UGC), welcomed the move to establish a joint task force to assist global universities in setting up branch campuses in India. “These are exciting times for higher education,” he said.Kumar added: “With the foreign university campus regulations being given the final touches by UGC for the announcement soon, we look forward to working with the liaison office of the diplomatic outposts to facilitate establishing foreign university campuses in India.”Kumar noted that the meeting between Modi and academic leaders in the US will give them a “clear picture of India’s aspirations and potential and help accelerate the collaboration process in the higher education sector”.The AAU interim report also suggested that embassies in the US and India needed to “build the front doors” to each other’s country. Dedicated liaison offices should assist universities to navigate the “myriad legal hurdles” to establish non-profit academic centres or satellite campuses in-country and assist on the hosting country’s tax and regulatory landscape, it said.The AAU task force has already been meeting monthly “to determine key focus areas for bilateral research and education cooperation, to identify existing programmes that could provide blueprints for future partnerships, and to formulate strategies on how best to move forward”, according to the AAU.“This interim report is a key first step in better leveraging the immense potential and resources of India and the United States to further scientific advancement, economic growth and national security for both countries,” said AAU President Barbara R Snyder, inviting feedback to draw up the final report which AAU plans to release later this year.During his 21-24 June visit, Modi met with members of the AAU task force and other US university leaders and visited the US National Science Foundation (NSF), in Alexandria, Virginia. The NSF is an independent federal US agency that supports education and research in the non-medical sciences and is headed by Indian-American Sethuraman Panchanathan.Speaking at NSF, where he was accompanied by US First Lady Jill Biden, Modi said: “To maintain growth momentum, India and the US need a pipeline of talent. On the one hand, the US has top-class educational institutions and advanced technologies. On the other hand, India has the world’s biggest youth factory. That is why I believe that the India-US partnership will prove to be the engine of sustainable and inclusive global growth.”The visit also saw the two countries sign defence and technology agreements, including to sell US drones to India and to co-produce fighter jet engines in India, to invest in India’s nascent semiconductor industry and to train Indian astronauts at the US space agency NASA, among many other announcements.Adrian Mutton, founder and CEO of the Sannam S4 Group, an international business consultancy which helps US and other foreign universities in tie-ups with companies and universities in India and elsewhere, attended some of the events organised around Modi’s visit and highlighted the importance of higher education.“To have both Prime Minister Modi and [US] Secretary of State [Antony] Blinken directly engaging with university presidents from the US, and the NSF, I think is a game changer,” he said.“Prime Minister Modi and Secretary Blinken, at the end of a very long week of many announcements in many areas, chose in their remarks to speak specifically about higher education,” Mutton toldHe added: “For the prime minister [Modi] to go and visit NSF as part of his US tour is a very deliberate use of his time. I take that as an excellent sign [that] it [research and higher education] is on his personal radar”.“It is an enormous statement of intent because once Prime Minister Modi engages, it’s impossible for the [Indian] bureaucracy to avoid that,” said Mutton, noting that in the past higher education discussions tended to be only at the bureaucratic level of senior officials.“Partnerships between the US and Indian institutions have been slowly building up over the past several years, but what was different with the Modi visit was that it was a message right from the top about how important these sorts of partnerships are,” Rajika Bhandari, co-founder of the recently launched US-based South Asia International Education Network (South Asia-IEN), told“There are India-US bilateral relations on so many fronts, but higher education at that senior policy level is often left out of the conversation because so much of their focus is on science and technology and trade and other sorts of investments,” she noted. “But as we look at investments, we see how critical those research collaborations are in that higher education space. So, higher education needs to be front and centre of these sorts of conversations.”Dr Uttiyo Raychaudhuri, vice-provost at the University of Denver and also a co-founder of the South Asia-IEN, attended several of the events around Modi’s visit and remarked not only on the scale of the “pomp and show” but also on the turn-out of the highly successful Indian diaspora at the many events.“There is so much intellectual capital and entrepreneurship capital – the capacity for innovation is incredible,” he said, noting that half a dozen university presidents, many of Indian origin, attended the state dinner at the White House on 22 June.Raychaudhuri added that these kinds of ‘visuals’ were important for higher education partnerships to rise up the agenda.Referring to Modi’s visit to NSF, Raychaudhuri told: “A huge focus of the [Indian] government is [on] the next phase of AI-related work. They want to know about quantum [computing], about AI, and they want talent – their own talent that has left their shores – to come back, and also to bring in talent from here in the US and collaborate.”“Prime Minister Modi made a very pointed statement that he wanted more US students to come to India,” Raychaudhuri added.The AAU interim report on US-India higher education partnerships is closely linked to a special technology initiative on critical and emerging technologies. This was announced during bilateral talks between Biden and Modi in Tokyo in May 2022, based on “shared security interests and aims to grow technological and industrial collaboration between the two nations”, according to the joint statement at the time.Minister Pradhan referred to the initiative on 24 June in comments on Modi’s US visit. “The recently launched India-US initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) will usher in a new phase of partnership, given the vibrant talent pool in India and the US, particularly in new age technologies and the synergistic research and development centres of excellence in our academic institutes,” he said.“This formal partnership, with its complementary expertise and incorporation of industry collaboration and startup enablers, will facilitate free flow of ideas, student exchange and joint IPRs [intellectual property rights],” he said.“This academic partnership will help in developing solutions for a sustainable and secure future. This is a historic moment when two strong nations are joining hands in education and research that is bound to make a global impact in the coming years,” he added.The AAU interim report recommended the expansion of internship and apprenticeship opportunities for Indian and US undergraduate and graduate students, as well as for post-doctoral researchers, which it said would be critical to meet the objectives of iCET. “This will require a coordinated effort to establish short-term placements in companies and non-governmental organisations for practical training,” it said.Mutton noted that much of Modi’s visit focused on large corporations, with the US committing to setting up some manufacturing to India as part of its shift away from China. “Within a few years, the manufacturing will be done in India, so it’s [about] the localisation of that expertise. And that is an absolute priority for Prime Minister Modi,” he said.“India’s perspective is that it has the need and the opportunity to localise a lot of the expertise. I think this is why Prime Minister Modi went to the NSF – to see how India can capitalise on what is an enormous amount of human brain capital in the country.”Mutton noted that India has recognised that “as part of that entire value chain, a lot of the expertise that feeds into the R&D that then becomes the manufacturing output or the service output or the knowledge output, comes from these university partnerships”.“India doesn’t tend to produce and own much of its own intellectual property,” he said. “They’re now looking at ways of partnering with international universities to bring that expertise into India and to learn from it and emulate and improve on it,” Mutton said, noting that much of that research would be funded by industry.“Historically, much of the research collaboration and partnerships that are undertaken between US universities and Indian ones are undertaken by NRIs,” he said, referring to Non-Resident Indians, or Indians abroad. “They are academics that have gone from India to the US and partnered with people they know, or they’ve gone to the US for a while and come back to a university in India and are now reaching out to colleagues in the US.”Raychaudhuri noted that his email inbox was “flooded” with requests from “all kinds of universities in India – smaller universities, private universities – who want to connect [with us] because of our rankings of excellence in research”.“On the Indian side, they are seeing this as an opportunity, and they want to collaborate. So, this is a very important juncture when change can happen,” he said. “US universities have a very good opportunity to sit around the table now and make these things happen.”He said the University of Denver had very little in the way of partnerships in India but is now connecting with the Indian Institute of Management Indore to conduct some research on the urban environment in both countries.However, he acknowledged that “one of the key things moving forward with the collaborations would be a shared allocation of resources, or at least some sense that there will be ease in resource availability”.The AAU interim report pointed to funding deficiencies and issues around dividing the costs of research as an area that could hamper tie-ups, as well as regulatory and policy barriers in the US visa system, US export control policies, and the Indian Foreign Contribution Regulation Act which restricts transfers of funds, and structural and cultural issues in the countries’ higher education systems.“The immense complexity of the combined US and Indian regulatory environments is itself a major barrier to additional collaboration,” it said.“Even well-resourced institutions have found it difficult to navigate these waters, and those that have are often forced to rely on external consultants to find their way. Those unable to afford such support have chosen not to pursue collaborations,” the report said.“Without a commitment by both countries to provide significant investments to support new and much larger partnerships, collaborations will continue to remain localised and uncoordinated, with limited impact in furthering each nation’s strategic priorities.”Nonetheless, there is momentum. Mutton noted that some US universities were at the stage of “formally doing due diligence on what it would take to set up some form of campus”, though not necessarily a multidisciplinary full-fledged branch campus in India.“A couple of US universities were trying to get announcements in time for Prime Minister Modi’s visit, but there just wasn’t enough time for them to get all of the internal clearances to do that. There are some that want to take ‘first mover advantage’,” he said. “But it’s still going to take time”.Mutton added that “relatively highly ranked” US universities could make announcements of operations in India by the autumn or earlier.

Joint Statement from India and the United States



Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed United States President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., to India today, reaffirming the close and enduring partnership between India and the United States. The leaders expressed their appreciation for the substantial progress underway to implement the ground breaking achievements of Prime Minister Modi’s historic, June 2023, visit to Washington.

The leaders called on their governments to continue the work of transforming the India-U.S. Strategic Partnership across all dimensions of our multifaceted global agenda, based on trust and mutual understanding. The leaders re-emphasized that the shared values of freedom, democracy, human rights, inclusion, pluralism, and equal opportunities for all citizens are critical to the success our countries enjoy and that these values strengthen our relationship.

President Biden lauded India’s G20 Presidency for further demonstrating how the G20 as a forum is delivering important outcomes. The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the G20 and expressed confidence that the outcomes of the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi will advance the shared goals of accelerating sustainable development, bolstering multilateral cooperation, and building global consensus around inclusive economic policies to address our greatest common challenges, including fundamentally reshaping and scaling up multilateral development banks.

Prime Minister Modi and President Biden reaffirmed the importance of the Quad in supporting a free, open, inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Modi looked forward to welcoming President Biden to the next Quad Leaders’ Summit to be hosted by India in 2024. India welcomed the U.S. decision to co-lead the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative Pillar on Trade Connectivity and Maritime Transport, further to the U.S. decision to join IPOI in June 2023.

Continuing to share the view that global governance must be more inclusive and representative, President Biden reaffirmed his support for a reformed UN Security Council with India as a permanent member, and, in this context, welcomed once again India’s candidature for the UNSC non-permanent seat in 2028-29. The leaders once again underscored the need to strengthen and reform the multilateral system so it may better reflect contemporary realities and remain committed to a comprehensive UN reform agenda, including through expansion in permanent and non-permanent categories of membership of the UN Security Council.

Prime Minister Modi and President Biden reaffirmed technology’s defining role in deepening our strategic partnership and lauded ongoing efforts through the India-U.S. Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) to build open, accessible, secure, and resilient technology ecosystems and value chains, based on mutual confidence and trust, which reinforce our shared values and democratic institutions. The United States and India intend to undertake a midterm review of iCET in September 2023 to continue to drive momentum toward the next annual iCET review, co-led by the National Security Advisors of both countries, in early 2024.

President Biden congratulated Prime Minister Modi and the scientists and engineers of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Chandrayaan-3’s historic landing at the south polar region of the Moon, as well as the successful launch of India’s first solar mission, Aditya-L1. Having set a course to reach new frontiers across all sectors of space cooperation, the leaders welcomed efforts towards establishment of a Working Group for commercial space collaboration under the existing India-U.S. Civil Space Joint Working Group. Determined to deepen our partnership in outer space exploration, ISRO and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have commenced discussions on modalities, capacity building, and training for mounting a joint effort to the International Space Station in 2024, and are continuing efforts to finalise a strategic framework for human space flight cooperation by the end of 2023. India and the United States also intend to increase coordination on planetary defence to protect planet Earth and space assets from the impact of asteroids and near-Earth objects, including U.S. support for India’s participation in asteroid detection and tracking via the Minor Planet Center.

The leaders reiterated their support for building resilient global semiconductor supply chains, noting in this respect a multi-year initiative of Microchip Technology, Inc., to invest approximately US$300 million in expanding its research and development presence in India and Advanced Micro Device’s announcement to invest US$400 million in India over the next five years to expand research, development, and engineering operations in India. The leaders expressed satisfaction at the ongoing implementation of announcements made in June 2023 by U.S. companies, Micron, LAM Research, and Applied Materials.

Sharing a vision of secure and trusted telecommunications, resilient supply chains, and global digital inclusion, Prime Minister Modi and President Biden welcomed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Bharat 6G Alliance and Next G Alliance, operated by Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions, as a first step towards deepening public-private cooperation between vendors and operators. They further acknowledged the setting-up of two Joint Task Forces focused on collaboration in the field of Open RAN and research and development in 5G/6G technologies. A 5G Open RAN pilot in a leading Indian telecom operator will be undertaken by a U.S. Open RAN manufacturer before field deployment. The leaders continue to look forward to the participation of Indian companies in the U.S. Rip and Replace Program; President Biden also welcomed India’s support for a Rip and Replace pilot in the United States.

The United States reiterated its commitment to working together with India in the quantum domain, both bilaterally and through the Quantum Entanglement Exchange, a platform to facilitate international quantum exchange opportunities; and welcomed the participation of India’s S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Kolkata, as a member of the Quantum Economic Development Consortium. It was also recognized that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay joined the Chicago Quantum Exchange as an international partner.

The leaders hailed the signing of an Implementation Arrangement between the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and India’s Department of Biotechnology to enable scientific and technological research collaborations in biotechnology and biomanufacturing innovations. They welcomed the call for proposals released by NSF and India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to foster academic and industrial collaboration in semiconductor research, next generation communication systems, cyber-security, sustainability and green technologies, and intelligent transportation systems.

Reaffirming their commitment to building resilient technology value chains and linking defence industrial ecosystems, the leaders recommitted their administrations to promoting policies and adapting regulations that facilitate greater technology sharing, co-development, and co-production opportunities between Indian and U.S. industry, government and academic institutions. They also welcomed continued engagement through an inter-agency monitoring mechanism under the auspices of the bilateral Strategic Trade Dialogue, launched in June 2023.

The leaders welcomed the signing of an MoU between Indian universities, represented by the Council of Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT Council), and the Association of American Universities (AAU) to establish the India-U.S. Global Challenges Institute, with a combined initial commitment of at least US$10 million. The Global Challenges Institute will bring together leading research and higher-education institutions from across our two nations, including beyond AAU and IIT membership, to advance new frontiers in science and technology, spanning collaboration in sustainable energy and agriculture, health and pandemic preparedness, semiconductor technology and manufacturing, advanced materials, telecommunications, artificial intelligence, and quantum science.

The leaders also welcomed the growing number of multi-institutional collaborative education partnerships, such as those between New York University-Tandon and IIT Kanpur Advanced Research Center, and the Joint Research Centers of the State University of New York at Buffalo and IIT Delhi, Kanpur, Jodhpur, and BHU, in the areas of critical and emerging technologies.

The leaders affirmed the importance of efforts to close the gender digital divide in the digital economy, noting a G20 commitment to halve the digital gender gap by 2030 and expressed support for the Women in the Digital Economy Initiative, which brings together governments, private sector companies, foundations, civil society and multilateral organizations to accelerate progress toward the closure of the digital gender divide.

Prime Minister Modi and President Biden reaffirmed their commitment to deepen and diversify the India-U.S. Major Defence Partnership through expanded cooperation in new and emerging domains such as space and AI, and accelerated defence industrial collaboration.

The leaders welcomed completion of the Congressional Notification process on 29 August 2023 and the commencement of negotiations for a commercial agreement between GE Aerospace and Hindustan Aeronautical Limited (HAL) to manufacture GE F-414 jet engines in India, and recommitted to work collaboratively and expeditiously to support the advancement of this unprecedented co-production and technology transfer proposal.

The leaders applauded the conclusion of a second Master Ship Repair Agreement, with the most recent agreement signed by the U.S. Navy and Mazgaon Dock Shipbuilders, Ltd., in August 2023. Both sides recommitted to advancing India’s emergence as a hub for the maintenance and repair of forward-deployed U.S. Navy assets and other aircraft and vessels. The leaders also welcomed further commitments from U.S. industry to invest more in India’s maintenance, repair, and overhaul capabilities and facilities for aircraft.

The leaders commended the India-U.S. Defence Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X) team for establishing a robust collaboration agenda to harness the innovative work of the U.S. and Indian defence sectors to address shared security challenges. INDUS-X convened the inaugural Academia Start-up Partnership at IIT Kanpur, with the participation of Penn State University, and initiated the Joint Accelerator Program for Indian Startups, through a workshop led by U.S. accelerator M/s Hacking 4 Allies (H4x) and IIT Hyderabad in August 2023. Both sides also welcomed the announcement by the Indian Ministry of Defence’s Innovations for Defence Excellence and the U.S. Department of Defense’s Defense Innovation Unit to launch two joint challenges, which will invite start-ups to develop solutions to shared defence technology challenges.

President Biden welcomed the issuance of a Letter of Request from the Ministry of Defence of India to procure 31 General Atomics MQ-9B (16 Sky Guardian and 15 Sea Guardian) remotely piloted aircraft and their associated equipment, which will enhance the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities of India’s armed forces across all domains.

Reiterating the importance of nuclear energy as a necessary resource to meet our nations’ climate, energy transition, and energy security needs, Prime Minister Modi and President Biden welcomed intensified consultations between the relevant entities on both sides to expand opportunities for facilitating India-U.S. collaboration in nuclear energy, including in development of next generation small modular reactor technologies in a collaborative mode. The United States reaffirmed its support for India's membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group and committed to continue engagement with like-minded partners to advance this goal.

The leaders welcomed the inaugural meeting of the India-U.S. Renewable Energy Technologies Action Platform [RE-TAP], in August 2023, under which the two countries will engage in lab-to-lab collaboration, piloting, and testing of innovative technologies; collaboration on policy and planning to advance renewable energy and enabling technologies; investment, incubation and outreach programmes; and training and skill development to accelerate the uptake and adoption of new and emerging renewable technologies and energy systems.

Reiterating the importance of decarbonizing the transport sector, the leaders welcomed progress to expand electric mobility in India, including joint support for a payment security mechanism financed through both public and private funds. This will accelerate the procurement of 10,000 made-in India electric buses including those for the Indian PM e-Bus Sewa program that will include the associated charging infrastructure. The two countries are committed to working together to help diversify the global supply chain for e-mobility.

India and the United States are also advancing the creation of investment platforms to lower the cost of capital and accelerate the deployment of greenfield renewable energy, battery storage and emerging green technology projects in India. Towards this end, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund and the U.S. Development Finance Corporation exchanged letters of intent to each provide up to US$500 million to anchor a renewable infrastructure investment fund.

The leaders lauded the settlement of the seventh and last outstanding World Trade Organisation (WTO) dispute between India and the United States. This follows the unprecedented settlement of six outstanding bilateral trade disputes in the WTO in June 2023.

The leaders welcomed efforts to develop an ambitious ""Innovation Handshake” agenda under the India-U.S. Commercial Dialogue, to include two anchor events in the fall (one in India and one in the United States), in which our two sides will collaborate to bring together start-ups, private equity and venture capital firms, corporate investment departments, and government officials to forge connections between the two countries’ innovation ecosystems.

The leaders welcomed our growing bilateral cooperation in cancer research, prevention, control, and management, and looked forward to the launch of the India-U.S. Cancer Dialogue in November 2023. This dialogue will focus on advancing knowledge in cancer genomics, developing new diagnostics and therapeutics to enhance and strengthen cancer care including for underserved urban and rural communities. The leaders also highlighted the upcoming U.S.-India Health Dialogue, taking place in October 2023 in Washington, D.C., underscoring their joint commitment to strengthening and facilitating scientific, regulatory, and health cooperation between our two nations.

The leaders welcomed the renewal of a Memorandum of Arrangement between the U.S. Department of Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency and the Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI) to facilitate recovery from India of the remains of fallen U.S. service members who served in World War II.

Prime Minister Modi and President Biden pledged to sustain the high-level of engagement between our governments, industries, and academic institutions and realize their ambitious vision for an enduring India-U.S. partnership that advances the aspirations of our people for a bright and prosperous future, serves the global good, and contributes to a free, open, inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific.

During his address at the State Dinner, Modi raised a toast for his ""wonderful"" hosts. He raised it for good health, prosperity and the pursuit of happiness to liberty, equality and fraternity, and to the ever-lasting bonds of friendship between India and the US.

""With every passing day, Indians and Americans are getting to know each other better. We can pronounce each other's names correctly. We can understand each other's accent better. Children in India become Spider Man on Halloween, and America's youth is dancing to the tune of 'Naatu Naatu',"" the prime minister said.

328,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/21/narenda-modi-washington-dc-biden-white-house-visit-india-china,‘India is now a linchpin’: US looks to Narendra Modi’s visit to counter China,2023-06-21 00:00:00,"The symbolism of the visit will be hard to avoid. As Narendra Modi arrives in Washington DC on Wednesday – the capital of a country he was once prohibited from visiting for almost 10 years – he will join the ranks of Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Volodymyr Zelenskiy as one of the few leaders to address a joint session of Congress more than once.

Statements from US officials ahead of the visit have been rapturous on the subject of US-India relations, praising the “significant defence partnership” and describing it as “a unique connection between the world’s oldest and largest democracies”. Before his departure from India, Modi said: “This special invitation is a reflection of the vigour and vitality of the partnership between our democracies.”

Yet this trip – Modi’s sixth to the US since he came to power in 2014 but the first where a full state dinner will be given in his honour – is expected to yield more than good optics for the Indian prime minister. Many expect it to further crystallise ties between two countries and boost a relationship that has been on an upwards trajectory for two decades – even as they remain fundamentally opposed on several key issues. Defence, technology, security, AI, telecoms, visas, manufacturing and space are all said to be on the table. Meanwhile, the issues of the erosion of democracy in India and the shrinking space for dissent and civil society under Modi are unlikely to be discussed in depth.

Now the world’s most populous country – with 1.4 billion people and rising – and the world’s fifth largest economy, India’s growing prominence, both economically and geopolitically, makes it a country that the Biden administration – like those of Trump, Obama and Bush before it – could not ignore. Yet most experts say that it is China that has been the fundamental driver of this growing alliance; and as Modi touches down in DC, mutual concerns over Beijing’s aggressive, expansionist agenda have never been more acute.

Since Modi last visited the US in 2019, when Donald Trump was in the White House, China’s actions along its 2,100-mile (3,500km) border with India have become increasingly antagonistic. In 2020, the two sides came the closest they had been to war in 70 years when troops clashed along the Himalayan border in Ladakh, killing dozens of soldiers, after Chinese troops encroached on land typically patrolled by India. Since then, China has built up vast amounts of infrastructure along disputed territory and shown little desire to disengage in key areas of contention.

This has coincided with a shift in Washington’s relationship with China, from that of strategic competitor to rival or outright threat that must be deterred and contained. The bipartisan consensus is that India is a crucial geopolitical, and even economic, counterweight to China’s dominance in the Indo-Pacific region.

“In Washington, the hope is to build out an extended framework of deterrence to try and keep China in check,” said Milan Vaishnav, director of the south Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Both geographically as well as strategically and economically, India has become a linchpin in this framework.”

This geopolitical alignment over China – which also drove the formation of the Quad, a security grouping of India, the US, Australia and Japan – has led to an unprecedented flourishing of security and defence cooperation between the US and India. There has been increased intelligence sharing and joint military exercises in the Himalayas close to the China border, and Modi’s US visit is expected to yield several defence deals for surveillance technology and drones.

India has embraced Washington’s new willingness to share its advanced technology and cyber resources, given that its own technological advancements have lagged far behind China’s. Modi will be hoping to close a landmark deal allowing US giant General Electric to produce jet engines in India, to power Indian military aircraft. It will be the first time such a collaboration on military technology has taken place, sending a clear message to China.

While there is little expectation of trade deals between the two countries, trade between India and the US reached a record $191bn in 2022, making the US India’s largest trading partner. There is an interest on both sides in building up India as an economic and manufacturing alternative for big western companies to wean it off its dependency on China – 95% of iPhones are currently made in China, for example, but Apple is slowly shifting manufacturing to India, which is expected to produce 25% of iPhones by 2025.

The limits of a US-India relationship

Yet for all the gushing rhetoric about being “partners of first resort”, experts have also been quick to point out the limitations of the US-India relationship.

Writing in Foreign Affairs, Ashley Tellis, one of the key negotiators for the US nuclear deal with India, warned that even as the Biden administration continued to invest heavily in India, it should not have any “delusions of New Delhi becoming a comrade-in-arms during some future crisis with Beijing”, particularly in terms of India actively taking the US side if China invades Taiwan.

India will never be the kind of ally that the Americans have found in the Anglosphere Avinash Paliwal of the University of London

“India will never be the kind of ally that the Americans have found in the Anglosphere: this is not going to be Australia, Canada or the United Kingdom,” said Avinash Paliwal, an associate professor in international relations at Soas University of London.

“India thinks of itself as a power on its own merit and it has its own geographical compulsions, its own kind of power and its own aspirations on a regional and global scale. There is a meeting of minds and interests at the moment but that’s not something that will last for ever.”

Another issue that looms large over Modi’s visit is that of human rights, in particular the democratic backsliding and the attacks on minorities in India since his populist, Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power. They are allegations that have haunted Modi even before he was prime minister, when his alleged role in the Gujarat riots led to him being banned from the US for a decade.

They have been well documented by the Biden administration. Last year, the state department’s report on international religious freedom documented the challenges to freedom of expression, extrajudicial killings and discrimination against minority groups in Modi’s India, prompting India to call the report “flawed and biased”. More recently, the Commission on International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan agency appointed by Congress, recommended in May that the state department designate India a country of concern for “ongoing and egregious religious freedom violations”.

Before Modi’s visit, Amnesty International called on the US to confront India on the deterioration of human rights and Human Rights Watch organised a screening for US policymakers of a BBC documentary that was critical of Modi, and which was banned in India earlier, as a deliberate reminder of the attacks on freedom of speech under his government.

Yet no US president since Bill Clinton has been forthright on human rights in India, and though the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, did make a rare reference to a rise in “human rights abuses” last year, the Biden administration is expected to continue to keep quiet on any discomfort it may have over Modi’s populist, religious nationalist politics in the name of building strategic security ties. Already several White House officials have made recent references to India’s “vibrant democracy”.

“It’s unlikely to come up, at least in this round of conversations,” said Paliwal. “The Americans are OK doing business with quasi- or undemocratic countries and so I don’t see the democratic decline in India dislocating the glue that is binding the top levels of the two governments or preventing them coming together to deal with the China question.”

Russia, which was briefly a source of contention between India and the US, is also unlikely to be brought up by Biden. India’s historic ties to Russia, which provides almost 80% of its defence and weapons, have ensured that Modi has refused to condemn Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, instead taking a neutral stance, and in the meantime India has become the biggest buyer of cheap Russian oil. While there was initial pushback from Washington, the consensus among analysts is that the Biden administration has now accepted India’s deep-rooted relationship Russia; some believe it has even hastened US cooperation with India on defence to help the country become less dependent on Russia.

But for Modi, this visit can also serve a more personal political purpose. In the US, the Indian diaspora is now one of the largest immigrant groups – second only to Mexicans – and its members occupy influential positions in tech, business, banking and law, and some have even become well-known faces in Hollywood. Emphasising these people-to-people ties, and the vital contributions Indians have made in the US, is also likely to be a prominent part of Modi’s trip.

With India’s next general election less than a year away, the optics of Modi being given full honours by the US president are also likely to play well to the electorate back home. Modi is expected to win a third term in office and his popularity is credited in part to an image among voters that he has made India into a respected player on the world stage and is now courted by powerful western leaders.

“Since independence, India has seen itself as an international power but felt it did not get the recognition or role it deserved,” said Tanvi Madan, director of the India Project at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC. “But Modi seems to believe that endorsements from the US, far from generating a backlash, generate a sense of optimism that this is India’s moment.”"

Narendra Modi, once denied a U.S. visa, is now poised to be a showstopper at the White House. The Biden administration is sparing no effort as it prepares to welcome the Indian prime minister later this week at a state dinner, only the third under the current president. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight As Modi gets set to address Congress for a second time, it might look as if India is pivoting to the United States. But don’t be naive, my dear American friends. India will never be your ally.

And this won’t change whether Modi or one of his rivals wins next year’s election. India’s collective memory of the indignities of colonization creates wide public support for an independent path.

India’s policy of nonalignment began with a refusal to be entangled in the Cold War. Today this has morphed into aggressive multilateralism. Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar says India should benefit “from as many ties as possible.”

So if you’re expecting monogamy, prepare to be disappointed. India has reserved the right to flirt with Russia, Iran — and even China — if its national interests dictate such a need.

After the 9/11 attacks, Washington asked New Delhi to dispatch troops to Afghanistan. The Indian military vetoed the request. When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee withheld military support despite pro-U.S. Indian media urging him to get “on the right side of history” — a phrase often used today in the context of the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Resisting pressure from the George W. Bush administration was a brave move — and, as it turns out, the morally superior one.

These days, New Delhi similarly refuses to toe the American line on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. India’s import of cheap Russian oil continues to break records. Anyone who wants to see Indian leaders stand up and publicly assail the Kremlin — one of their main suppliers of weaponry and a valuable source of raw materials — is in for a long wait.

India has criticized the U.S. decision to block Iranian and Venezuelan oil from the open market. The government in New Delhi has actively worked to bring Iran into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a multilateral forum created by Russia and China in 2001. In May, India hosted the SCO foreign ministers amid border tensions with China and continuing antagonism with Pakistan. A fortnight later, unapologetic about the seeming contradiction, Modi and President Biden were hugging and laughing for the cameras at a meeting of the Quad, a loose security partnership that also includes Australia and Japan.

Of course, India’s growing cooperation in the Quad raises hackles in Beijing. And yes, India’s issues with China are grave. Just three years ago, India lost 20 soldiers in a deadly mountain clash with Chinese troops along their common frontier in the high Himalayas.

But don’t think for a moment that India will take its cue from America on China; New Delhi wants to manage the relationship on its own terms. Indians have held 18 rounds of talks with the Chinese to resolve the border dispute. Meanwhile, India remains a key participant in the Beijing-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. As a founding member, India holds the second-largest number of voting shares after China, which at 30 percent effectively enjoys veto rights.

There’s no question that the United States and India have much in common. They are both open and argumentative societies. Diversity is the strength of both nations.

Even so, it’s not the romance of shared values that is bringing the two countries together. It’s the reality check of geopolitics.

India will agree that there is a strategic and urgent need to contain the spread of China, which is already throwing money at smaller countries in South Asia — Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan — to buy influence. China is also flexing its muscles in the Indian Ocean — New Delhi’s strategic backyard — and the broader Indo-Pacific region."

331,https://apnews.com/article/biden-modi-india-state-visit-human-rights-5e4bc32e679ad6bae7225a28f7f6334d,Biden and Modi cheer booming economic ties in visit that also reckoned with India’s record on rights,2023-06-22 09:03:50,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Thursday pronounced the U.S.-India relationship never stronger and rolled out new business deals with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as human rights activists and American lawmakers questioned the administration’s decision to honor the leader with a pomp-filled state visit.

In a joint news conference with Modi, Biden called the relationship between the U.S. and India among the most consequential in the world and “more dynamic than at any time in history.” He underscored how two of the world’s most powerful democracies were cooperating on issues such as the climate, health care and space, saying that the U.S-India economic relationship was “booming.”

But Modi bristled at a reporter’s question about his country’s commitment to democratic values as the country has seen an erosion of religious, political and press freedoms under his watch.

“Democracy is our spirit,” Modi, who rarely takes questions from journalists, said through an interpreter. “Democracy runs in our veins. We live democracy and our ancestors have actually put words to this concept.” He said India has “proved that democracies can deliver and when I say deliver, this is regardless of class, creed, religion, gender.”

Yet Modi has faced criticism over legislation amending the country’s citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalization for some migrants but excludes Muslims, a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists, and the recent conviction of India’s top opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modi’s surname.

Nevertheless, later in a 59-minute address before a joint meeting of Congress, Modi insisted that in India “diversity is a natural way of life.”

“We are home to all faiths in the world, and we celebrate all of them,” added Modi, in a line that brought many cheering lawmakers to their feet.

The premier’s description runs counter to accusations by rights groups of widespread attacks and discrimination against India’s Muslims and other minorities under Modi.

A group of more than 70 lawmakers wrote to Biden this week urging him to raise concerns about the erosion of religious, press and political freedoms during the visit. At least six Democratic lawmakers —Democratic Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Greg Casar of Texas, Jamaal Bowman and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — boycotted Modi’s address to Congress, because of concerns about his human rights records.

“When it comes to standing up for human rights, actions speak louder than words,” Bush, Tlaib, Omar and Bowman said in a joint statement. “By bestowing Prime Minister Modi with the rare honor of a joint address, Congress undermines its ability to be a credible advocate for the rights of religious minorities and journalists around the world.”

Standing alongside Modi, Biden emphasized that press, religious and other fundamental freedoms should be at the core of how both democracies operate. During their Oval Office meeting, Biden said, he and Modi had a “good discussion about democratic values” while Modi said “there’s absolutely no space for discrimination” when pressed about his own commitment on human rights.

The state visit, just the third of the Biden’s presidency, was certainly a glitzy affair.

Thousands gathered on the White House South Lawn for the welcoming ceremony, listening to performances by violinist Vibha Janakiraman and the a cappella group Penn Masala. As Modi arrived, the crowd — including many members of the Indian diaspora — broke out in a chant of “Modi, Modi, Modi.”

“All eyes are on the two largest democracies in the world, India and America,” Modi said. “I believe that our strategic partnership is important. I’m confident that working together will be successful.”

Later, Modi told Congress that “our partnership augurs well for the future of democracy” as the two countries expand partnerships in defense, semiconductor manufacturing and other industries. He also cheered the “samosa caucus”—the five U.S. House members of Indian descent—and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is Black and of Indian descent, as examples of the impact of the diaspora.

Biden administration officials say honoring Modi, the leader of the conservative Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is Diplomacy 101. The U.S.-India relationship will be vital in coming decades as both sides navigate an ascendant China and the enormity of climate change, artificial intelligence, supply chain resilience and other issues.

“On the issues that matter most that will define the future, our nations look to one another including on critical regional and global issues,” Biden said.

Among the announcements made Thursday is an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.

The Biden administration also announced plans to bolster India’s semiconductor industry. U.S.-based Micron Technology has agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending more than $800 million and India financing the rest. U.S.-based Applied Materials will launch a new semiconductor center for commercialization and innovation in India, and Lam Research, another semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will start a training program for 60,000 Indian engineers.

On the space front, India signed on to the Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space exploration cooperation among nations participating in NASA’s lunar exploration plans. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station next year.

“We made critical and emerging technologies the pillar of our next generation partnership to ensure these technologies promote and protect our values, remain open, accessible, trusted and secure,” Biden added. “All this matters for America, for India and for the world.”

At the welcoming ceremony, Modi called the Indian diaspora in America — the millions of immigrants and their children from the subcontinent living in the U.S. — “the real strength” of the U.S.-India relationship. He said the honor of a formal state visit — the first in the U.S. for India since Barack Obama honored Modi’s predecessor, Manmohan Singh, in 2009 — reflected the positive impact Indians are having worldwide.

Modi, the son of a tea seller who rose to be India’s premier, also recalled that the first time he visited the White House was three decades ago as a “common man.”

“I have come here many times but today for the first time, the doors of the White House have been opened for the Indian American community in such large numbers,” Modi said to an estimated crowd of 7,000.

Despite the major deals, the visit was shadowed by concerns laid out by rights activists and lawmakers who question Modi’s commitment to democratic principles.

In 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi’s visa to the U.S., citing concerns that, as chief minister of the state of Gujarat, he did not act to stop communal violence during 2002 anti-Muslim riots that left more than 1,000 people dead. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.

Biden and Modi have also had differences over Russia’s war in Ukraine. India abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and refused to join the global coalition against Russia. Since the start of the war, the Modi government has also dramatically increased its purchase of Russian oil.

White House officials note that there are signs of change in India’s relationship with Russia, which has long been New Delhi’s biggest defense supplier.

India is moving away from Russian military equipment, looking more to the U.S., Israel, Britain and other nations. Modi recently met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and has spoken out about his worries about the potential use of nuclear weapons by Russia.

Modi, before Congress, said the war is “causing great pain” in Ukraine and having residual effects on Europe and beyond.

“This is not an era of war, but it is one of dialogue and diplomacy” Modi said. “And we must all do what we can to stop the bloodshed and human suffering.”

Without specifically naming China, Modi also addressed heightened tensions in the region, saying “dark clouds of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo Pacific.”

Later Thursday, Modi attended a lavish White House state dinner in his honor.

As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits the United States and addresses U.S. Congress this week, Americans generally regard India favorably. But many have never heard of Modi, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted March 20-26, 2023. Those who have heard of the Indian leader tend to lack confidence in him.

How we did this Ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States in June 2023, Pew Research Center analyzed Americans’ knowledge and views of India and its leader. For this analysis, we surveyed 3,576 U.S. adults from from March 20 to March 26, 2023. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.

About half of U.S. adults (51%) have a favorable view of India, while a somewhat smaller share (44%) have an unfavorable view.

Attitudes vary slightly by educational attainment: 55% of Americans with a bachelor’s degree or higher view India positively, while 50% of those with some college or less education say the same.

Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are also somewhat more likely than their Republican and Republican-leaning counterparts to see India favorably (56% vs. 48%).

Looking at India’s position globally, most U.S. adults (64%) believe the country’s influence in the world has stayed about the same in recent years. Another 23% say India’s influence has gotten stronger, while 11% say its influence has weakened.

Men are more likely than women to say India’s influence has been getting stronger, as are those with a bachelor’s degree or more education when compared with those without a college degree. (Men in the U.S. were also more likely than women to answer the question.) U.S. adults who closely follow international news are also more likely than those who follow it less closely to see India as a growing power.

When it comes to India’s prime minister, a substantial share in the U.S. (40%) say they have never heard of him. Americans under 30 are particularly likely to say they do not know who Modi is (59%). In comparison, 28% of U.S. adults 65 and older say the same. Adults with less education are also more likely than those with higher levels of education to have never heard of Modi.

For those who have heard of Modi, the prevailing sentiment is negative: 37% have little or no confidence in his ability to do the right thing regarding world affairs, compared with 21% who are confident in him.

Americans are also largely unfamiliar with the Indian flag, according to the results of a 2022 Center quiz that gauged Americans’ knowledge of international affairs. When presented with a picture of India’s flag, only 41% of Americans correctly identified the country it represents.

Americans with a bachelor’s degree or higher were more likely than those with less education to correctly attribute the flag to India, as were younger Americans when compared with their older counterparts. Liberal Democrats were also 16 percentage points more likely than conservative Republicans to correctly identify the Indian flag.

Reaffirming commitment to their growing partnership and a shared focus on the Indo-Pacific, India and the United States touched base on critical world problems during high-level talks this week.

With the Israel-Hamas conflict raging, the Russia-Ukraine war grinding on, and China's assertiveness continuing in the Indo-Pacific.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met their Indian counterparts in New Delhi.

Blinken arrived in New Delhi from South Korea, the latest leg of a marathon trip that has included a G7 foreign ministers' meeting in Japan and a whirlwind tour of the Middle East.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to the US in June, which included deals to boost cooperation in key areas including defense, space and trade, has prompted closer ties between the two nations.

This week's discussions picked up the threads from Modi's successful visit to Washington and President Joe Biden's trip to New Delhi for the G20 summit in September.

""We're building on a rather remarkable year of engagement, and I think it's just evidence of the fact that we have not only the strongest bilateral partnership we ever had but also a regional one and, indeed, a global one,"" Blinken said in his opening remarks.

Containing China

Former diplomats and experts believe the ongoing momentum can be leveraged to strengthen bilateral ties further and build strategic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific vis-a-vis China.

""Deepening India-US ties lay a favorable balance of power in Asia and keep a check on authoritarian China's push for hegemony in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, the US expects India to play an off-shore balancing role in shaping and correcting the regional architectural balance,"" Sreeram Chaulia, professor and dean at the Jindal School of International Affairs, told DW.

""The US wants India to take a more active role in the sub-regions where it expects it to be a moderator, an aggregator, and a connector. It wants India to be part of the 'hub-and-spoke' model,"" said Chaulia, adding the US is calling on allies and partners across the Indo-Pacific to help deter China's aggressive behavior.

Under the ""hub-and-spoke"" model, the US serves as the hub while Asian nations with military ties to it form the spokes. It is a system that helps the US consolidate its policy influence over Asian allies, supervise inter-alliance cooperation, and increase cooperation.

Israel-Hamas war looms in the background

As the Israel-Hamas conflict continues, India has urged both sides to shun violence, de-escalate the situation and create conditions for an early reopening of direct peace negotiations towards a two-state solution to the Palestinian issue.

India has historically balanced its relations with the Israelis and the Palestinians. But after the horrific Hamas attack on October 7, India expressed solidarity with Israel while also reiterating its support for a two-state solution.

""The subtle shift in India's position on the Palestinian issue which was on display is part of the more general shift in India's foreign policy in getting closer to the US and the West. And Israel has emerged as a trusted partner over the last few years,"" former Indian ambassador Mohan Kumar told DW.

The conflict has likely put new initiatives on hold, such as an envisioned India-Middle East Economic Corridor and cooperation among the I2U2 grouping of India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States.

""India is one of the few countries which can credibly talk to both the Palestinian Authority and to Israel. So, India can potentially play a mediation role. What remains to be seen is whether India will be asked specifically by the two sides to mediate and whether it has the 'agency' to do it,"" Kumar added.

Meera Shankar, a former envoy to the US, also maintained that while India has supported Israel's right to defend itself against terrorism, it has also reiterated its support for a two-state solution and for alleviating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

""The impact of this crisis on the broader region and on the India-Middle East Corridor is likely to figure in the talks. India would also be concerned that in dealing with these crises, the US does not take its eye off the ball from the serious challenges in the Indo-Pacific,"" Shankar told DW.

Expanding US-India ties

""Both sides would also review their bilateral ties and the progress made on the important decisions taken by President Biden and Prime Minister Modi to strengthen their strategic partnership,"" Shankar added.

During Modi's visit to the US, an ambitious slate of agreements was unveiled, ranging from advanced technology cooperation to climate change and the production of fighter jet engines to investments in semiconductors and countering terrorism.

""We are expecting progress in bilateral strategic defense partnership negotiations especially, by negotiating an early conclusion of security of supply arrangement and the reciprocal defense procurement agreement,"" K P Vijayalakshmi, professor and head of geopolitics and international relations at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, told DW.

""India seeks to balance the China challenge by stimulating its partnership with the US, with whom it has signed foundational agreements, enhanced commercial dialogue, and signed the initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET),"" added Vijayalakshmi.

New Delhi has invited Biden to India's Republic Day celebrations as part of its plan to host the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue leaders' summit in January 2024.

""The relationship will get a further fillip if Biden accepts. After that, both countries will be in election mode next year,"" said Chaulia.

334,https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/23/politics/china-us-india-state-visit/index.html,China was the ghost at the US-India feast,2023-06-23 00:00:00,"CNN —

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi basked in the most lavish honors that the US can bestow on a visiting leader. But for much of his state visit, the specter of an uninvited guest hovered over Washington and the future of US-India relations.

China – and the growing belief that the US is on a collision course with the Asian power – is driving the relationship between Washington and India. That helps explain why President Joe Biden and Congress feted Modi despite the fact that his populist Hindu nationalist government has presided over a significant erosion in human, political, press and religious freedoms in a way that appears to violate the US leader’s push for global democracy.

Biden made clear that he sees India as vital to helping preserve the Western-led global international order, a set of rules-based principles and values that China is seeking to challenge. But despite Thursday’s pageantry, there are deep questions over whether the Modi government, while seeking to leverage its warming ties with Washington to its own advantage, sees itself in quite the same role as a linchpin of US diplomatic strategy. It remains unclear, for instance, whether India would throw its full weight behind Biden in the event that any of the increasingly alarming US-China confrontations escalates into a full-scale military or diplomatic standoff.

The backdrop of Modi’s visit – a feud over a Chinese spy balloon’s trip across US skies earlier this year, which was just reignited by Biden publicly branding Chinese leader Xi Jinping as a dictator – showed just why India’s growing strategic weight could be so valuable to the US.

The president denied on Thursday that his comments, in the relaxed atmosphere of a Democratic Party fundraiser this week, had sunk his effort to rescue disastrously poor US-China relations. He said he had no plans to stop calling things as he sees them. He also drew a contrast between Washington’s ties with Beijing and those with India.

“One of the fundamental reasons that I believe the US-China relationship is not in the space as with the U.S.-Indian relationship is that there is an overwhelming respect for each other because we’re both democracies,” Biden said.

Biden’s decision to grant one of his term’s rare state visits to Modi represented a doubling down of a strategy to draw India into the Western orbit, which was initiated as far back as the Clinton administration and was accelerated by Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Like most of his predecessors, he pointed to political synergy in the governing systems in India and the United States, both once under British colonial rule.

Biden’s embrace of Modi also put him in the odd position of drawing praise from some Republicans who are committed to an even more robust policy toward China and often accuse him of being soft on Beijing. He effectively offered Modi cover in a news conference in which the US side persuaded the Indian prime minister to take the unusual step of taking questions.

“We believe the dignity of every citizen, and it is in America’s DNA, and I believe in India’s DNA that the whole world – the whole world has a stake in our success, both of us, and maintaining our democracies,” Biden said. “(This) makes us appealing partners and enables us to expand democratic institutions across around the world.”

Modi, meanwhile, offered exactly the kind of words that his American hosts wanted to hear, describing US-India relations as more important than ever before and saying that they could together be “successful in enhancing the strengths of the whole world.”

Did Biden infringe his values to recruit a new member to the anti-China front?

Biden’s embrace of Modi exposed him to criticism that he trampled his own calls for the preservation of global democracy, human rights and press freedom, given the democratic backsliding in India.

“In order to advance these values with credibility on the world stage, we must apply them equally to friend and foe alike, just as we work to apply these same principles here in the United States,” a group of 70 Democratic lawmakers wrote to the president regarding Modi’s visit.

Biden faced the same kind of criticism when he traveled to Saudi Arabia last year and fist bumped Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after vowing on the 2020 campaign trail that he would make the kingdom a pariah over the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

Biden’s wider goal is the preservation of the international liberal order that is under assault from China and Russia. This may insulate him from criticisms that erupt whenever an American president sets a moral grounding for US foreign policy and then inevitably faces criticism that he’s prioritizing grubby geopolitical interests over core American values.

Obama addressed this very conundrum in an exclusive interview with CNN broadcast on Thursday.

“Look, it’s complicated,” Obama told Christiane Amanpour. “The president of the United States has a lot of equities. And when I was president, I would deal with figures in some cases who were allies, who, you know, if you pressed me in private, do they run their governments and their political parties in ways that I would say are ideally democratic? I’d have to say no.”

The China factor

Modi visited Washington at a time when there is an almost universal belief across both parties that China’s rise poses a dangerous challenge to US power, influence and the entire Western-led system of economic and political rules. This is taking priority over concerns about democracy in India, which are becoming increasingly acute. In March, for instance, the main opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was thrown out of parliament after he was convicted in a defamation case centering on Modi’s name that critics said was politically motivated. There have also been raids on foreign and local media outlets and increased faith-based oppression.

US officials insisted this week that the Modi visit was not about China. But in a way in Washington, these days, everything is about China.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican who has often spoken about the need to fight autocracy abroad, summed up the mood surrounding Modi’s visit in a statement.

“Our nations’ economic and security interests overlap on many of the most pressing issues, especially the growing hostility of the Chinese Communist Party in the Himalayas and in the Indian Ocean,” the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said.

From Washington’s perspective, India appears a promising partner in its effort to counter China, which has seen the Biden administration strengthen the defense component of alliances with Japan and Australia and reengage the Philippines in an initiative that will lead to more US troops being stationed on the soil of a longtime ally that sometimes flirts with China. India’s economy is benefiting from Western governments’ desire to wean themselves off Chinese supply chains. The Covid-19 pandemic and a spike in inflation underscored how painful over-reliance on a manufacturing base vulnerable to political confrontation could be.

Tensions and exchanges of fire across China’s long border with India have, meanwhile, raised the question of whether New Delhi’s most dangerous foe is Beijing rather than Pakistan. India has also become a participating member of the Quad security forum that also involves the leaders of Australia, Japan and the US and met recently in Japan.

Will India deliver after lavish US attention?

In his address to a joint session of Congress on Thursday, Modi moved toward the US position and was clearly referencing Beijing’s expansive sovereignty claims in the region that are not recognized by international law. He said India shared the US vision of a “free open and inclusive Indo-Pacific” marked by freedom of navigation defined by international law and was against the domination of any one nation.

Even in the cloaked language of international diplomacy, those comments represented a significant statement of alignment with the US position and a message to China.

Yet the world often behaves very differently than policy makers in Washington expect. While there was much talk of Biden supposedly compromising his principles on democracy, there was less attention this week on what kind of payoff the US can expect for an intense engagement with India. Could New Delhi, for instance, simply rack up significant wins while pursuing its own path?

One of the most significant deliverables from this summit, for instance, was a deal that will see General Electric partner with an Indian firm to build jet fighter engines after years of relying on Russian and Soviet weaponry. The agreement sent a message to both Beijing and Moscow – America’s primary adversaries.

No one in Washington expects India to become a formal US ally. It has always resisted being drawn into organized alliances and is now positioning itself as the leader of the developing world. Its policies also sometimes conflict with those of the US. It has been an eager customer, for example, of cheap oil from Russia despite sanctions over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. And it is unlikely that despite closer defense ties India would line up alongside the United States in a military confrontation with China over Taiwan or in the South China Sea.

Ashley Tellis – one of the architects of a civil nuclear energy cooperation deal with India in the Bush administration, which was a platform for years of subsequent engagement with New Delhi – warned last month that the US was making a “bad bet” with Modi.

“India’s significant weaknesses compared with China, and its inescapable proximity to it, guarantee that New Delhi will never involve itself in any U.S. confrontation with Beijing that does not directly threaten its own security,” Tellis wrote in Foreign Affairs.

“India values cooperation with Washington for the tangible benefits it brings but does not believe that it must, in turn, materially support the United States in any crisis—even one involving a common threat such as China.”

Such a view reinforces the idea that India and the US may have different ambitions and visions for their ever-tightening relationship, and the possibility that Biden could end up being disappointed in the returns for his attention on Modi.

But at a time when every foreign policy question eventually comes down to a broader confrontation with China, even incremental gains from this visit could benefit the US."

Modi, 72, was first elected prime minister in 2014 and then reelected in 2019. Since then, Modi has earned an international reputation as an unyielding Hindu nationalist and a strongman who leads with tight control.

We are political scientists who have written extensively on U.S. foreign policy and the relationship between the U.S. and India, as well as democracy.

Over the past few years, particularly since Modi’s 2019 reelection, some scholars and analysts have written about democracy declining in India. This is partly because of new regulations and government pressure to censor news media and free speech critical of Modi.

The U.S. does not routinely give state visit invitations to world leaders. Modi is also set to address Congress, another honor that is rarely granted to a visiting foreign dignitary.

But in our view, the U.S. is courting India because it needs the country to serve as a strategic bulwark against China’s expansionist policies in Asia.

Understanding Modi

Modi grew up in India’s western state of Gujarat, in fairly modest circumstances. He had a long career in local and state politics and developed a reputation as a tough-minded, but able, politician.

A longtime member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a militant Hindu political organization, Modi has been characterized by Indian political observers and foreign analysts alike for his strong Hindu nationalist views.

Hinduism is the most popular religion in India,, but people there also practice Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism.

Hindu nationalism has been on the rise in recent years, spawned by some people’s belief that India is and should be a predominantly Hindu nation, and that its policies should reflect that.

At times, this rise in Hindu nationalism has taken a violent turn.

When Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat in February 2002, Hindu zealots carried out a riot there that killed more than 1,000 people – most of whom were Muslim. Modi has denied any role in this event, but police have said that the violence happened with tacit approval of the state government, including Modi.

The U.S. subsequently denied Modi a visitors visa in 2005.

But Modi has been a widely popular prime minister, with a 78% approval rating as of February 2023.

US and India ties

Ties between the U.S. and India grew under Modi’s leadership, especially around issues of security and defense cooperation.

India, for example, has purchased a substantial amount of sophisticated weaponry from the U.S. over the last few years. It has also signed three important defense agreements with the U.S. during this same time frame.

Defense analysts say that these agreements will significantly improve military cooperation between the two countries.

India has also become, albeit somewhat fitfully, a more active participant in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, which is a loose, four-country initiative that also involves the U.S., Japan and Australia. The group routinely meets to discuss security and trade, and occasionally carries out military exercises together.

These countries also share concern about China’s growing power in Asia. While India and China have an established trading relationship, different security issues – especially related to the disputed Himalayan border between the countries – have dogged diplomatic relations between them for nearly a decade.

An important point of contention between the U.S. and India involves India’s tepid response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

India has been reluctant to publicly criticize Russia in part because of its acute dependence on Moscow for weapons technology.. Modi has been in regular touch with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but has not condemned the invasion, only going so far as to say that now is “not an era for war.”

Questions dogging the visit

The Biden administration’s decision to invite Modi for a state visit is clearly designed to send a message to New Delhi about the significance that it attaches to the emerging U.S.-India partnership and India’s potential role in containing China’s growing strategic reach across Asia.

Modi is running for reelection in 2024. So, especially if the visit yields any tangible benefits for India, the meeting could result in some electoral gains at home.

Biden and Modi will likely discuss how to continue growing the countries’ relationships and how to respond to China’s influence – as well as the ticklish question of India’s position on the Ukraine crisis.

The U.S. is aiming to sell India armed drones, and Biden is also likely to offer India GE jet engine manufacturing technology. This would give India’s defense capabilities a significant boost and would also lessen its dependence on Russian military technology.

Questions about a weakening democracy in India, though, as well as violence against minorities, may come to dog the relationship.

Hindu extremist groups have increasingly attacked and harassed minorities, most notably Muslims, over the last few years.

Modi’s administration has also received international attention for its curbs on the freedom of the press, attempts to muzzle nonprofit groups and efforts to undermine the political opposition.

Because questions of democracy and the Ukraine war are so fraught, we believe that these issues could stall more political agreements and closer ties between the U.S. and India. How Biden and Modi tackle these various subjects during the visit could help determine the course of U.S-.India relations."

Narendra Modi’s trip to the White House may be the most important visit from an Indian leader since 2008 as Delhi weighs a deeper relationship with Washington.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States may be the most important since the countries signed a nuclear deal 15 years ago.

When then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Washington after the nuclear agreement in September 2008, he was extravagant in his praise for then-US President George W. Bush.

At a state dinner, he told Bush : “The people of India deeply love you. And all that you have done to bring our countries closer together is something that history will remember forever.”

The hype for this visit is even greater.

US President Joe Biden has described US-India ties as the “defining relationship” of the 21st century while his Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has termed Modi’s visit as historic. Modi and Biden face elections next year, so both sides expect their meeting to pay positive dividends domestically.

Not only is the Cold War period of estrangement between the so-called oldest and largest democracies well and truly over, but the two sides are unwilling to let past and current irritants impact on their relationship.

Neither India’s unwillingness to condemn Russia over the war in Ukraine, or the concerns of some in the US over religious freedom and minority rights in India, dampened preparations for the visit, described by officials as big on symbolism as well as potentially substantial agreements.

Modi is only the third leader in India’s history to be accorded a state visit, and, after this visit, the only one who will have addressed a joint session of the US Congress twice.

While there is strategic convergence on geo-political issues, it is understood Modi’s visit will focus on geo-economics. Washington and Delhi are deeply concerned about China’s rise, and its role in the Indo-Pacific and on the border with India.

But this visit is about translating common concern into a deeper and wider defence and technological relationship.

This will be reflected in several substantial agreements, including those that will allow India access to advanced technology while creating jobs in the US, strengthening Modi’s “Make in India” programme while giving a boost to American industry.

One “deal” negotiators from both sides have been working on, which could be announced during Modi’s visit, is an Indian order for maritime drones at a potential cost of USD$3 billion.

This comes on top of the deal between Air India (now owned by Indian company Tata) and US-based Boeing for 290 airplanes at nearly USD$45.9 billion that Biden says will create one million jobs across 44 states in the US.

The success of the state visit will largely hinge on the joint US-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET). In the lead-up to Modi’s Washington visit, the countries’ National Security Advisors have met twice.

The framework includes a series of programmes aimed at strengthening the innovation ecosystems in the US and India, as well as the possibility of collaboration on defence technology and jet engine production.

It also seeks to forge a resilient supply chain for semiconductors that could result in a design, manufacturing and fabrication ecosystem housed in India.

Cooperation on space-related issues and collaboration on the next generation of telecommunications also fall under the umbrella of the framework, which could cement a long-term bilateral partnership.

Rarely has India established such an overarching framework of cooperation with another country on critical and sensitive areas. Even with the Soviet Union, with which it had a special relationship, the collaboration was not as broad-based or deep across sectors.

While Delhi will keep flagging its “strategic autonomy” in foreign policy, the Modi visit to the US will also announce the limits it has set for its non-alignment. Where India sets those limits could define the next iteration of its international relations.

337,https://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/implications-of-modis-state-visit-to-us,Implications of Modi’s State Visit to U.S.,2023-06-29 11:30:27+08:00,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States from June 21 to 24 drew widespread attention from the international community. It was Modi’s sixth visit and first official state visit. To highlight its importance to U.S.-India relations, the United States made unprecedented arrangements for receiving the Indian leader. Modi was invited to address a joint session of Congress, a privilege previously only bestowed on a select few political figures, such as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill during World War II and Nelson Mandela of South Africa.

U.S. President Joe Biden hosted a state banquet for Modi, praising the significance of U.S.-India relations, commending Modi’s contributions and expressing optimism about future developments. Modi was thrilled to affirm the U.S.-India relationship using the popular abbreviation AI, which has become popular worldwide.

Before the trip to Washington, both India and the U.S. had touted it as highly significant. The Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that the visit would concentrate on strengthening the strategic partnership between India and the U.S., with a focus on developing a comprehensive and forward-thinking global strategic partnership. The White House echoed this sentiment, asserting that Modi’s visit would reinforce the already deep relationship between America and India, strengthen friendship between the two nations and create a “partnership between our two great countries, which spans the seas to the stars.”

During Modi’s discussions with President Biden, the two leaders explored various essential topics for establishing a strategic partnership, including creating a technology cooperation partnership for the future that involves space and ocean cooperation, technology transfers, export controls, new tech development and artificial intelligence. Additionally, both sides agreed to further promote defense partnerships and related industry cooperation, such as the United States transferring fighter jet engines and selling large armed sea drones to India. They also discussed critical mineral supplies, advanced infrastructure cooperation, clean energy, and regional and global security.

Modi’s visit to the United States achieved multiple breakthroughs in U.S.-India relations, including the signing of several cooperation agreements in trade, investment, energy, climate, defense and technology. Of those agreements, the most significant may have been the United States allowing General Electric to produce jet fighter engines in India. This fulfills India’s longstanding demand for advanced domestically produced fighter jets, which are crucial for enhancing India’s defense production capacity by reducing dependence on imported aircraft.

Additionally, 31 MQ-9B Maritime Guardian armed drones will be sold to India by the United States. This is worth highlighting, as these drones will significantly bolster the combat capabilities of the Indian military and have a multiplier effect in potential conflicts with adversaries. It’s also important to note that India and the United States reached an agreement on the sharing of defense information and exchanging military liaison officers. This is an area of great sensitivity, and its impact on neighboring countries cannot be overstated.

The significant breakthrough in diplomatic relations between India and the United States was influenced by various geopolitical and geo-economic factors. The United States aims to maintain its preeminent position in the Asia-Pacific and Indo-Pacific regions, contain and encircle other nations that may resist its hegemony and reinforce an exclusionary geopolitical group — the Quad — to form a unified force allowing it to pursue its own strategic interests. The United States has made significant efforts and invested considerable resources into India, offering preferential treatment that even some of its long-term allies have not received.

Meanwhile, India is undergoing rapid development, and it aspires to become a major global power in the near future. Therefore, it is keen to cultivate relations with the world’s only remaining superpower, the United States, in order to gain geopolitical advantage, attract money and technology, and acquire advanced weaponry. To that end, it’s not surprising that India, the most populous nation in the world, is drawing closer to the sole superpower, the United States.

U.S.-India relations will continue to deepen, based on the current trend of development. However, their relationship requires further exploration. This is because India and the United States have different national strategies. Although their interests and pursuits coincide significantly, there are still significant differences between them.

For instance, on global governance, the United States seeks absolute power under its unipolar dominance, while India pursues multipolarization and maintains cordial relations with multiple entities on the international stage. The United States does not like to see this happening. Similarly, in national governance, the United States contests and criticizes many issues in India, which India deems unacceptable.

Likewise, there are significant differences in economic, trade and investment interests between India and the United States. In terms of the India-U.S. relationship itself, the United States pursues a strategic relationship, while India, at most, wants to be strategically related but will never abandon its fundamental diplomatic philosophy of strategic autonomy.

Many of India’s positions on important international issues do not align with what the United States would prefer. Additionally, India will not forego any opportunities or options to strengthen diplomacy and improve relations with other countries that play significant roles in geopolitics. This is all part of a comprehensive effort to safeguard India’s historical opportunities for development."

339,https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/australia-needs-to-be-clear-eyed-about-india-relationship-after-modi-visit/,Australia needs to be clear-eyed about India relationship after Modi visit,2023-05-25 01:00:13+00:00,"An Australian official once told me that Australians struggle to think beyond the American-led Anglosphere and alliance.

There might have been some hyperbole in that remark. But certainly the struggle we have in properly understanding our burgeoning relationship with India—and India as a country—suggests that official was on to something.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Sydney this week demonstrates that Australia and India are committed to one another, despite history working against us.

From the 1960s until 2014, the two countries had at best sporadic engagement.

It’s significant that Modi continued with the visit despite the cancellation of the Sydney Quad summit after US President Joe Biden was unable to travel, which then led to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also pulling out.

It should not be forgotten that Modi’s trusted foreign minister, S. Jaishankar, has been to Australia three times in the past year.

This demonstrates the importance that India places on Australia—in terms of the political relationship, regional strategic alignment and the large diaspora of citizens and residents with Indian heritage. The decades in which the US has been our dominant strategic partner have shaped Australia to the point that we tend to see everything through that prism.

That helps to explain the predictable reactions we have seen to Modi’s visit: in particular, looking for inconsistencies between the two countries in terms of values, with critics pointing to human rights issues and arguing that New Delhi won’t provide military support if Beijing and Washington are heading towards a conflict, say over Taiwan.

The fact that both Australia and India are democracies is a very solid foundation for a good strategic relationship. But it should not be turned into more than that. India has its own interests, as does Australia. India, especially through the diplomacy of its foreign minister, is nothing less than open about that. India is never going to be an ally in the way the US is—but it doesn’t need to be in order to be a vital partner.

It’s not a mistake to point out that Australia and India share some values but not others. It is a mistake, however, to act like we need our partners to be identical or isolate ourselves. The test is not whether a partner is a democracy without flaws.

Rather, the test for our partnership is our commitment to a common set of strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific, to be addressed by a dual-track approach, involving offering our region viable, practical options for security and prosperity while constraining the most malicious activities of Beijing across territorial encroachment, technological oppression and foreign influence.

‘We have very different histories, of course,’ Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said this week when asked about India’s relationship with Russia. ‘India has been a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement for such a long period of time. But India is a great supporter of peace and security and stability in our region.’

And in this regard India has the heft in population and influence in the region. Evidence of this can be seen in Modi’s invitation to the G7 in Japan and his visit to Papua New Guinea before coming to Australia, where he met with 14 Pacific leaders under India’s Forum for India–Pacific Islands Cooperation. Notably, PNG Prime Minister James Marape referred to Modi as ‘the leader of the global south’.

In his statement after meeting Modi on Wednesday and in his media interviews, Albanese sensibly didn’t overstate shared values—despite getting a barrage of questions in interviews about Indian democracy and New Delhi’s relationship with Moscow. Indeed, in his statement issued on Wednesday morning he mentioned neither democracy nor values.

Albanese and Modi’s meeting on Wednesday yielded mainly practical areas of cooperation: trade and investment, migration, green hydrogen, a new consulate and so forth.

But the overwhelming benefit of the partnership is that Australia doesn’t want a region dominated by one power. It wants an inclusive region, in which power is shared and aggression and coercion are deterred. And it understands that it has to work with others, including India and Southeast Asian countries.

The strength and maturity of the relationship is reflected in the fact that the two countries can discuss their individual and collective interests, which includes open discussion of the tensions in the relationship. Indeed one of the biggest changes in the past few years is that the differences can be discussed. The relationship is now that intimate and joins a short list of countries in that category for Australia, including the US, the UK and Japan.

So, where does the relationship go from here? Defence cooperation and trade are moving at a very strong pace, as is work through the Quad grouping with Japan and the US. The visit going ahead despite everything else around it being upended shows that the Australian and Indian governments are clear-eyed about what they need individually and collectively.

The challenge for Australian foreign policy is to get more creative and find a proper place for a country like India that is not politically or culturally as resonant as the US is for Australians, and is not in our immediate region, which is Southeast Asia and the Pacific—but is still a clear strategic partner in the pursuit of this vision for the region."

The visit will put on full display the ""deep and close partnership"" between the U.S. and India, the White House said, despite concerns India's democratic principles have eroded under Modi's leadership.

The relationship has been described by Biden as ""one of the most important"" of this century as the U.S. rebalances its foreign policy focus to the Indo-Pacific in the face of an increasingly aggressive China. Just ahead of Modi's visit, President Biden suggested Chinese President Xi Jinping was a ""dictator.""

""There's a strategic imperative in the region,"" Tanvi Madan, the director of The India Project at the Brookings Institution, told ABC News. ""Multiple administrations have seen India as a geopolitical counterbalance, an economic alternative and a democratic contrast to China.""

The two leaders greeted each other warmly on the South Lawn in a welcome featuring marching bands and honor guards, despite rainy weather. Vice President Kamala Harris, the first person of Indian descent in her role, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were also there to greet the prime minister.

""The challenges and opportunities facing the world in this century require that India and the United States work and lead together, and we are,"" Biden said.

Modi said the partnership between the U.S. and India ""will be instrumental in enhancing the strength of the whole world.""

Biden and Modi met in the Oval Office and appeared side by side at a brief news conference in the East Room, a rarity for Modi who only held his first-ever press conference in India in 2019 after being in power for five years.

Modi also appeared on Capitol Hill to address a joint meeting of Congress before a state dinner at the White House Thursday night.

The prime minister received a standing ovation as he entered the chamber to chants of ""Modi, Modi"" from members, though a handful of progressive Democrats boycotted the speech, citing reports of human rights abuses.

Modi took a moment to note those in the chamber who have Indian roots, turning to point to Vice President Harris seated behind him whom he celebrated as having ""made history.""

""We come from different circumstances and history, but we are united by a common vision. And, by a common destiny,"" Modi told lawmakers in closing. ""When our partnership progresses, economic resilience increases, innovation grows, science flourishes, knowledge advances, humanity benefits, our seas and skies are safer, democracy will shine brighter and the world will be a better place.""

About 400 guests are expected to attend the dinner, the White House said, which will include a plant-based menu and a mixture of American and Indian decor. There will be performances from American violinist Joshua Bell and from Penn Masala, a South Asian a cappella group from the University of Pennsylvania.

Modi's trip to Washington, though, isn't without controversy as the prime minister's been criticized for a rise in violence against religious minorities as well as a crackdown on the press and dissenters.

Some democracy watchdogs have downgraded India's rating in recent years. The U.S.-based Freedom House rated India as ""partly free"" in its 2023 report, and the Sweden-based Varieties of Democracy called India an ""electoral autocracy.""

""He's got a mixed record,"" Richard Rossow, chair U.S.-India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said of Modi. ""We do see at times he feels politically weak domestically, he's initiated steps that directly or indirectly seem to stoke the fears of religious intolerance by him and his party. And we've also seen crackdown on civil society to some extent.""

Human rights advocates and at least 70 lawmakers called on Biden to directly address human rights violations during Modi's visit. Experts told ABC News any human rights or democratic issues will likely be taken up in private between the two leaders.

Biden was asked during the news conference about those who've criticized his administration as overlooking such human rights concerns in hosting Modi.

""Look, the prime minister and I had a good discussion about democratic values,"" Biden responded. That's the nature of our relationship, we're straightforward with each other and we respect each other.""

""I believe that we believe in the dignity of every citizen and it is in America's and I believe in India's DNA that the whole world, the whole world has a stake in our success,"" the president continued. ""Both of us, in maintaining our democracies, make us appealing partners and enables us to expand democratic institutions across, around the world.""

Modi, meanwhile, sidestepped a question on recent allegations of human right abuses as he claimed in India ""there's absolutely no discrimination, neither on basis of cast, creed, or age, or any kind of geographic location.""

""I'm actually really surprised that people say so,"" the prime minister said as he defended his government. ""Indeed, India is a democracy ... democracy is in our DNA. democracy is our spirit. democracy runs in our veins. We live democracy.""

Also at issue during the trip was Russia. India, which has long relied on Russian oil and weapons, has avoided outrightly condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

But experts noted Modi's slight change in tone when it comes to Russia's invasion, such as his recent statements on the importance of territorial integrity and sovereignty.

""Both Washington and New Delhi understand that they will not necessarily see eye to eye on Russia,"" Kenneth Juster, who served as the U.S. ambassador to India during the Trump administration, told ABC News. ""But they can discuss that issue candidly with each other, and it is not going to have a negative impact on their broader strategic partnership.""

A senior Biden official said the White House would ""engage actively"" with India on issues related to Russia and Ukraine, specifically India's efforts to diversify away from Russian military equipment.

Talks between Biden and Modi also included trade, climate and space.

The two leaders announced a number of new commitments, including a joint space mission as well as various investments in technology, defense and clean energy.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking to the U.S.-India Business Council last week, touted trade between the two nations reached a record $191 billion. Blinken noted the U.S. is India's largest trading partner, and Indian companies invested more than $40 billion in the U.S. in IT, pharmaceuticals and more.

Though Juster said be believed there is still more work to do to advance on the trade front ahead of the state visit.

""For the world's largest economy, the United States, and its fifth largest economy, India, I believe that their bilateral trade relationship does not fulfill all of its potential. I am hoping that the two countries can continue to advance their trade and investment relationship both bilaterally and regionally, because economic issues are so important in the Indo-Pacific and China has a robust economic strategy for the region,"" he said.

Prior to landing in Washington, Modi met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk as well as other business leaders and health care experts.

He also marked International Day of Yoga by participating in a group session on the lawn of the United Nations headquarters.

The last time Modi visited the U.S. was in 2019, when he appeared alongside former President Donald Trump at a ""Howdy Modi"" rally in Texas attended by tens of thousands of people.

Billing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to the United States as the “most productive” ever, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said the U.S.-India relationship was doing “exceptionally well”.

Taking questions at a townhall event in New Delhi on Wednesday, his first public remarks after he returned from his visit to the U.S. and Egypt, where he went as part of Mr. Modi’s team, Mr. Jaishankar said the Prime Minister was seen internationally as a “more authentic Indian”.

However, he declined to comment on the controversy over comments by former U.S. President Barack Obama that were critical of Mr. Modi and minority rights in the country.

“We have had the most productive Prime Ministerial visit [to the U.S.] in our history if you look at the outcomes. One part of that is that it was a state visit, and the first time an Indian Prime Minister has addressed the U.S. Congress twice,” Mr. Jaishankar told an audience at the India International Centre, citing agreements in areas such as defence, trade, people-to-people ties, space, and science.

Referring to the introductory speech by IIC president and former Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran, who likened Mr. Modi’s visit to the 2005 visit by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, when the India-U.S. civil nuclear deal was launched, Mr. Jaishankar said that much had changed in the intervening 18 years.

“I think we were earlier in a state when we were trying really to address the obstacles of the relationship. Today, we have moved into the positive domain,” he added.

In 2005, Mr. Jaishankar was the Joint Secretary in the External Affairs Ministry in charge of the Americas, and had worked with Mr. Saran, who was then the Foreign Secretary, on the nuclear deal, which is still regarded a major milestone in India-U.S. ties.

Asked by an audience member about whether the recent visit to the U.S. and the GE-HAL jet engine MoU would “result in a big deal on technology research and development” in the way the 2005 visit resulted in the nuclear deal, Mr. Jaishankar said that the nuclear deal had been a “one-off” but that increasingly India and the U.S. were working as “countries with similar political, social, cultural, market values” particularly in digital and high technology cooperation, with private industries working together as well.

The Minister held the townhall as part of the BJP’s campaign marking nine years of the Modi government, as a part of which Ministers are travelling across the country to build awareness about the government’s programmes. This was Mr. Jaishankar’s fourth such programme in the capital.

Asked if the emphasis on nine years of government indicated that Mr. Modi intended to hold general elections, due in May 2024, earlier than scheduled, he replied, “Nine years is nine years, not 10 years, so please don’t read any [political] meaning into this programme.”

He also said that while the Modi government was “nationalistic” it also had an internationalist outlook, and Mr. Modi was seen by the international community as a “more authentic Indian” who “actually speaks for India”.

However, he declined to answer a question from The Hindu after the event, on his response to Mr. Obama’s interview to CNN that was critical of “authoritarianism” in India, and the need to improve the rights of minorities. Earlier this week, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had reproached Mr. Obama for his comments.

In opening remarks about the Modi government’s achievements, Mr. Jaishankar listed bettering ties in concentric circles of the immediate neighbourhood, and subsequently, South East Asia, the Gulf, Africa, the European Union and the Global South.

Singling out ties with Russia as “unique”, he said that it was a mistake to “dumb down” the India-Russia relationship by speaking only of India’s considerable defence dependence on Russian military supplies, and pointed to “geopolitical logic” of steady security cooperation and the growth in bilateral trade. Over the past year, bilateral trade between the two countries has soared due to a 50-fold increase in oil imports from Russia during the Ukraine conflict, from about 40,000 barrels per day in December 2021 to nearly 2 million bpd in May 2023.

He contrasted ties with Russia, with the relationship with China that has spiralled downwards since the stand-off at the Line of Actual Control since April 2020, repeating his earlier statement that ties would only normalise once the boundary was normal. He also said that ties with Canada had been impacted by the issue of Khalistani separatist groups present there. On Pakistan, he reasserted the government’s position that there would be no talks until cross-border terrorism ends."

Thursday saw the most anticipated events of the trip – Modi’s high-level bilateral talks with US President Joe Biden, followed by an address to the US Congress, and then the grand state banquet at the White House.

Here’s how various American dailies and leading news organisations covered the Indian PM’s visit, a day after his key engagements.

New York Times

Modi’s visit to the US came next only to the unfortunate implosion of a Titanic-research submersible on the New York Times‘s homepage on Friday, with its biggest story headlined “Biden Seeks to Bolster Ties With Modi While Soft-Pedaling Differences.”

“President Biden emphasized common ground with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India during a lavish state visit on Thursday, publicly skirting points of friction over the government’s crackdown on human rights in India and Russia’s war in Ukraine,” it stated.

The NYT article further opined that Biden “showered him (Modi) with expansive flattery” while making no evident progress resolving the disagreements – such as India’s position on the Russia-Ukraine war – which have been straining India-US ties.

Washington Post

A day after Modi addressed the US Congress at the White House, leading daily Washington Post stated in its article that Modi’s applauding of India’s democratic values during his speech appears contrary to the criticism his government is receiving.

“While addressing a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his country is ‘the mother of democracy’, comments that stood in contrast to his critics’ claims that India’s government has undermined democratic principles,” the WaPo story said.

The daily covered the PM’s visit extensively, allotting a special feature in Friday’s print edition to it. An article headlined “Biden defends India’s democracy as Modi visits” said that the US president was “praising an Indian leader who had been widely accused of overseeing a series of repressive moves in his country.”

On the grand state banquet hosted in Modi’s honour, WaPo wondered why “no one fun” was invited, questioning if “Modi is too controversial a leader for celebrities to clink glasses with? Or maybe it was to signal that this dinner was about serious diplomacy, as India’s profile rises on the world stage.”

In its article, “Biden Hails Stronger U.S. Ties to India in Meeting With Modi,” the WSJ observed that the arms deals made between Modi and Biden aimed at weaning India off arms purchases from Russia. “The two countries’ move toward greater cooperation stems from India’s strategic importance in the U.S. campaign to counter China, as well as American interest in stifling Russian influence in developing nations.”

USA Today

“For nearly a decade, Narendra Modi wasn’t allowed to set foot in the United States. But times, titles and political agendas change,” the USA Today, a middle-market daily, noted in its piece titled “Red carpets and yellow yoga mats: Five moments from Indian PM Modi’s state visit.”

The article remarks that the Biden administration has been embracing Modi more closely as it seeks to counter China’s global influence with India’s help.

CNN

An article by US-based news network CNN noted that the Indian PM’s visit required President Joe Biden to make certain trade-offs and Modi to step out of his comfort zone, for at least a few minutes during their joint press conference.

Alluding to Modi’s fielding of one question on discrimination against Muslims in India at the White House presser, the CNN story said, “It was a remarkable moment for a leader who does not hold news conferences, takes no questions from the press and hasn’t sat for an international interview. Press freedom groups say he’s overseen a crackdown on reporting.”

Several prominent figures from India's business community have expressed optimism about the outcomes of the visit and its potential impact on India's economy.

Share Market Live NSE

Ashish Chauhan, CEO of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), acknowledged the positive effects of PM Modi's visit on the Indian stock market. Chauhan said, “Nifty touched 19,000 today, and it is a great moment for India. But it is also a reflection of Mr. Modi's visit to US and the outcomes.""

He recalled that India was never part of the strategy orbit of US or western countries but now the United States is considering India as a partner in cutting-edge technologies such as 5G, 6G, quantum computing, space exploration, and other high-end tech fields.

Sanjay Nayar, former CEO of KKR India Partner, expressed his optimism regarding the emerging positive partnerships in the tech sector as a result of PM Modi's visit. One of the key strategic moves highlighted by Nayar was the Prime Minister's outreach to companies, policy-makers, and think-tanks.

“He had really been pragmatic and practical and there is obviously an equation that is there between Indian and the US people, but more than that his personal zeal and zest to go reach out to diverse set of people I think it is building a different kind of bond and frankly these kind of technologies come to you only when you have a huge amount of trust and understanding between each other.”

Additionally, Nayar noted that the Indian government's substantial investments in infrastructure are driving both investment and consumption, which, in turn, contribute to economic growth. He concluded by stating his expectations of Indian markets continuing to rise as more investments and increased consumption fuel growth.

Nilesh Shah, Managing Director of Kotak Mutual Fund, highlighted the positive sentiment towards India following PM Modi's visit to the USA. Shah stated, “Sentiment is positive towards India because there is hardly any country which has as strong macroeconomic foundation as India has today.”

While the stock markets may have reached all-time highs, Shah noted that valuations are not necessarily at all-time highs. Comparatively, Indian valuations are only slightly higher than those of its competitors, leaving room for further growth.

However, Shah emphasised the importance of India delivering on its promises of superior governance standards and green transformation to sustain the positive.

“Today investors are paying premium to enter India because they expect 3G from India - growth, governance and green transformation. As long as India delivers on this 3G I think our markets and economy both will do well.”"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the friendship between India and the US is a force for global good and will make the planet better as well as more sustainable.

PM Modi's remarks came in response to a tweet by US President Joe Biden in which he said that the friendship between the US and India is among the most consequential in the world.

I fully agree with you, @POTUS@JoeBiden! Friendship between our countries is a force of global good. It will make a planet better and more sustainable. The ground covered in my recent visit will strengthen our bond even more. 🇮🇳 🇺🇸 https://t.co/iEEhBIYG17 — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 25, 2023

""The friendship between the United States and India is among the most consequential in the world. And it's stronger, closer, and more dynamic than ever,"" Biden tweeted sharing a video montage from Prime Minister Modi's recently concluded state visit to the US.

Tagging Biden's tweet, PM Modi said on Twitter, ""I fully agree with you, @POTUS @JoeBiden! Friendship between our countries is a force of global good. It will make a planet better and more sustainable."" ""The ground covered in my recent visit will strengthen our bond even more,"" PM Modi said.

The Prime Minister had embarked on his visit to the US on June 20 and in New York, he led a historic event at the UN Headquarters to commemorate the ninth International Day of Yoga on June 21.

Later, in Washington DC, he was given a red-carpet welcome at the White House by President Biden. The two leaders held a historic summit on Thursday, followed by PM Modi's address to the US Congress and a state dinner hosted at the White House by the Bidens in his honour.

The visit was marked by several major deals to boost cooperation in key areas such as defence, space and trade.

348,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/modis-white-house-visit-highlights-deep-diaspora-divides-rcna89275,Modi’s White House visit highlights deep diaspora divides,,"Many South Asian Americans have mixed feelings as they prepare themselves for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to the White House this week.

As some get ready to gather in Washington, D.C., both to welcome and protest him, data from a 2021 study underscores just how torn the diaspora is when it comes to the controversial leader — and it shows that his popularity among Indian Americans falls short of how he is received in India.

This week marks Modi’s first official state visit to the U.S., which had not invited an Indian prime minister since 2009. Modi was once banned from the U.S. for the role he allegedly played in the deadly Gujarat riots, in which 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, were killed.

For many community leaders, a historic moment is severely marred by that and other aspects of Modi’s human rights record, including censoring journalists and stripping autonomy from the region of Kashmir.

“For this kind of a ruler to be invited to a state dinner by an American president and to be given an opportunity to speak to a joint session of Congress, where he’s going to talk about the ideals of democracy, is just mind-boggling,” said Ajit Sahi, the advocacy director for the Indian American Muslim Council.

The study, conducted by the Carnegie Endowment, found that Modi’s approval rating is much lower among Indian Americans (50%) than among Indians living in India (77%). Dozens of lawmakers in both houses of Congress signed a letter urging President Joe Biden to address human rights concerns with Modi during his visit.

“This is an important relationship that we need to continue and build on as it relates to human rights,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a briefing last month.

Sahi said that though Hindu nationalist sentiment in diaspora communities cannot be ignored, he thinks college-educated young people who grew up in the U.S. are distancing themselves from Modi’s politics.

“The American values of liberalism, progressivism, equality for all, justice for all, equality before the law, I think these are the things that more or less get deeply rooted in the psyche, especially if you were born and raised here,” he said.

But the diaspora in the U.S. is still split down the middle in terms of support for Modi. According to the study, 49% of Indian Americans rate his performance favorably, either strongly approving or approving of him; 31% disapprove of his performance; and 20% expressed no opinion on him at all.

“It’s a polarized space,” said Sunita Viswanath, a co-founder of the civil rights group Hindus for Human Rights. “There’s very little scope for bridge-building. ... On the one hand, you have this mainstream Hindu response, which is that India’s national leader is coming to town and is being greeted by the American president with a state dinner, and that puts India on the map.”

On the other hand, those in minority religions and castes oppressed in India say the visit feels as though the U.S. is validating the structural bias their families face, Viswanath said. Many in diaspora spaces say that bias has followed them.

“Inclusive secular democracy means the right for all the different religions to exist and practice freely,” she said. “We are Hindus, we are proud Hindus, but our Hinduism and our devotion to secular democracy, whether it’s in America, where most of us live, or in India, where most of us are from, that is what is motivating us.”

As South Asians in both camps plan to assemble in Washington throughout Modi’s three-day visit, some national organizations are urging Biden to address his recent actions.

The Committee to Protect Journalists issued a statement last week denouncing Modi’s media crackdown and the arrests of journalists since he came to power in 2014.

“Journalists critical of the government and the BJP party have been jailed, harassed, and surveilled in retaliation for their work,” CPJ President Jodie Ginsberg said in the statement. “India is the world’s largest democracy, and it needs to live up to that by ensuring a free and independent media — and we expect the United States to make this a core element of discussions.”

The Hindu American Foundation declined to comment on Modi’s visit. Overseas Friends of the BJP, an international arm of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, did not respond to requests for comment.

The Council on American Islamic Relations released a video and a petition opposing Modi’s visit to address a joint session of Congress on Thursday because of his anti-Muslim, anti-Dalit and anti-Sikh policies.

“The evidence of Modi’s expanding effort to place a boot firmly on the collective heads of India’s religious minorities is extensive,” the petition said.

Though it’s hard to predict how many Indian Americans will gather outside the White House, Modi’s 2019 trip to the U.S. drew over 50,000 to Houston for a rally called “Howdy Modi.” President Donald Trump co-hosted the event, calling it a “profoundly historic event.”

Viswanath remembers the experience four years ago, protesting outside the stadium as fellow Indian Americans poured inside.

“I was holding my sign, and people were streaming into the stadium dressed in their finest,” she said. “They looked like me. They looked like my family. It was one of those moments where I’m grateful I’m on this side of history. … Our deep hope, our ardent hope, is that as we build this space, Hindus will join us.”"

Toward this end, they committed to a holistic public health partnership to prevent and treat illicit drug use, address workforce shortages and skilling requirements, and showcase a secure, resilient, reliable and growing pharmaceutical supply chain as a model for the world.



55. Prime Minister Modi conveyed his deep appreciation for the repatriation of antiquities to India by the United States. Both sides expressed strong interest in working quickly toward a Cultural Property Agreement, which would help to prevent illegal trafficking of cultural property from India and enhance cooperation on the protection and lawful exchange of cultural property.



56. The Leaders welcomed the establishment of the Tamil Studies Chair at the University of Houston and reinstating the Vivekananda Chair at the University of Chicago to further research and teaching of India’s history and culture.



57. Prime Minister Modi looked forward to the visit of President Biden to the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi in September 2023.



58. Taken together, the leaders today affirmed that this document, in its breadth and depth, represents the most expansive and comprehensive vision for progress in the history of our bilateral relationship. Still, our ambitions are to reach ever greater heights, and we commit both our governments and our peoples to this endeavor, now and into the future.

US officials say it will be a “springboard” to touch new horizons, set “new benchmarks” in defence-industrial cooperation and propel the relationship into “escape velocity”. They say they are playing the long game with India.

Key members of President Joe Biden’s cabinet have spoken with unusual clarity and enthusiasm in recent days, stressing the path-breaking initiatives they have launched to break old taboos and overcome the hesitation that still exists within the US bureaucracy. The White House is calling the shots and projecting Modi's visit as the cement that will bind the two countries and “consecrate” the relationship -- to use the words of Kurt Campbell, the White House coordinator for the Indo-Pacific. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the two countries were at a “transformative moment” while on a visit to New Delhi earlier this month.

The flurry of reciprocal visits at senior levels is an important measure of intense engagement. It indicates a strong commitment on both sides to align, coordinate and complement each other in the face of unique challenges facing the world today. The year started with the two national security advisors -- Ajit Doval and Jake Sullivan -- inaugurating the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies or iCET as the overall framework across domains from defence cooperation to strategic trade to building resilient supply chains to collaboration in space to education.

INDIA'S STAND ON RUSSIA & CHINA UNDER WATCH

But at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue is Capitol Hill, where Modi faces different expectations. His address to a joint session of Congress will be scrutinised for India’s stand on Russia and China. Two key senators and long-time friends of India criticised New Delhi on Tuesday for taking “a pass” on the Ukraine war while speaking at the Ideas Summit organised by the US-India Business Council.

Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and co-chair of the India Caucus, said now that India had arrived as “a truly great and one of the most important nations in the world, they can no longer take a pass” on major issues of the day like Russia’s war on Ukraine. Senator John Cornyn, the Republican co-chair, sitting beside him was also critical. He said ""it was a little bit disappointing that when Russia invaded Ukraine, India took a pass"". Cornyn, however, qualified his remarks by acknowledging India’s “dependency on Russian weaponry” and 50 years of history between the two countries.

Warner also said he wanted the Prime Minister to address what many have called the shrinking space for dissent in India. He would like to see a “re-commitment” to the rule of law, a fair political process and a free press from Modi. He said he was “troubled” by some of the Indian government reactions that he deemed “a bit over the top” in an apparent reference to cases against journalists, the disqualification of Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi from Parliament and violence against minorities. Warner also said “India’s time has arrived” and praised India for standing up to China on the border.

If Modi and his political managers want a standing ovation in the US Congress, they might want to acknowledge the two big elephants in the room or the House chamber -- Russia and China. The comments of Warner and Cornyn reflect a wider sense of disappointment on Capitol Hill with India’s neutral position on the invasion. They also reflect the independence of the US Congress as a separate branch of government with its own mind and agenda.

US lawmakers will be looking for words that are more synonymous with the American position (Russia as the invader, China as the usurper) than India’s carefully crafted and parsed statements. How the Indian side handles the speech will be important. Only two other leaders have addressed the Congress this year -- Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (once formally and once informally) and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. While Zelenskyy was the obvious aggrieved party in American eyes, Yoon earned huge applause for comparing Russia’s invasion to North Korea’s attack against the South in 1950.

In addition to the speech, there may be statements and tweets by some members of Congress who are regular Modi critics, such as Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. It remains to be seen whether the Democratic leadership can persuade the critics to stay calm.

A BAG OF DELIVERABLES, PRIVATE DINNER & MEETINGS

In terms of the substance of the visit, administration officials have promised a bagful of “deliverables” and happy optics. The deliverables will indeed be significant, including an agreement to co-produce the General Electric (GE) jet engines in India starting with assembly and moving to actual production of parts and systems. Sources say that the technology transfer will be around 60 per cent and in stages. It is a hugely significant development given that talks stalled in the past over tech transfer issues. Both sides have since had an overdose of realism because of the “C” factor.

An equally important breakthrough could come in the field of semiconductors, where India is pushing for US companies to help create an ecosystem for assembling, testing and packaging. What’s different is that US officials and members of Congress have lent their voices to urge the private sector to think about India as an alternative to China. In the past, officials have countered requests to urge US corporates to invest in India with the plea: we can’t tell the private sector what to do. Well, now they are telling them to have a Plan B besides China.

Modi’s June 21-24 visit comes against this background and both sides will put their best foot forward to show intent and determination. The visit will start in New York where the Prime Minister will celebrate International Yoga Day at the United Nations, an Indian initiative launched by his government in 2014 that received overwhelming support in the UN General Assembly. Modi will fly to Washington the same day and stay at Blair House, the state guest house for visiting dignitaries across from the White House, also known as the “world’s most exclusive hotel.”

While details are still being worked out, word is that Modi will attend an event with First Lady Jill Biden centered on education given her expertise on the subject and Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu’s dogged efforts to create more linkages between US universities and community colleges and those in India. Modi will end the day with a private dinner with Biden and his family -- most likely at the White House -- for the two leaders to spend some quality time together. Will he walk or drive from Blair House to the White House is the biggest question for the security detail.

The official state visit is slated for June 22, starting with a ceremonial welcome on the White House lawns followed by bilateral talks. In the afternoon, Modi will go to Capitol Hill to address the joint session and become the only Indian Prime Minister to get the honour twice. In the evening the Prime Minister will be back at the White House for the state dinner with an estimated 250 guests representing the diversity of the Indian American community. Entertainment for the evening will include Indian touches.

HOW THE INVITATION CAME THROUGH

While the day’s many highlights will compete for top billing, the address to the Congress may grab headlines depending on what Modi says in his speech. The 2016 speech was short and punchy with the key phrase about shedding the “hesitations of history” being quoted ad nauseum. There was tremendous curiosity about Modi on the Hill. This time the situation is somewhat different. The Congress was enmeshed in debt ceiling negotiations and Speaker Kevin McCarthy was in a fight for political survival when the two co-chairs of the House India Caucus -- Congressmen Ro Khanna and Mike Waltz -- decided to push for an invitation for Modi.

Important business leaders, prominent Indian Americans and the Democratic leadership weighed in with Speaker McCarthy to issue the invitation in the midst of nerve-wracking negotiations on the debt ceiling. It seems a call from John Chambers, chairman emeritus of Cisco and chairman of US India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), to McCarthy made a big difference. Chambers, a legend in Silicon Valley, and McCarthy, a nine-term Congressman from California, go back a long way and Chambers, a Modi fan, is known to be especially persuasive when describing the potential of the India-US partnership. He calls himself the “biggest bull” on India and told PTI recently that India and the US were “joined at the hip at every level”. Mukesh Aghi, president of USISPF, got Chambers to urgently call McCarthy.

POWER LUNCH, DIASPORA GATHERINGS AND LIKELY PROTEST

After the state visit, Modi will attend a lunch hosted by Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the State Department on June 23. In addition to official events, Modi will address two diaspora gatherings, including one at the prestigious Kennedy Center organised by Aghi and USISPF. Members of the Indian American community are expected to come to Washington in large numbers to cheer Modi on Capitol Hill as well as outside the White House. It’s a packed schedule with many moving parts.

Besides the able Indian ambassador and his equally able team who are working hard to make the visit run smoothly, others are working equally hard in the opposite direction. For example, one overly active group has asked the Congressional leadership to “rescind” the invitation to Modi to address a joint session. Protesters are also expected to gather in public places to voice their anger against Modi and his party.

Critics, however, have failed to disturb the status quo. The strong bilateral relationship stands on two decades of hard work and political investment by both Democratic and Republican presidents in the US and the UPA and NDA governments in India. Support for strong India-US ties is bipartisan in the US and across parties in India.

Biden is a major star in the constellation of US and Indian interests that today are more aligned to keep Asia free of Chinese coercion even if they are not on the Russia question. As Secretary of State Antony Blinken reminded his audience on Tuesday in his speech to the USIBC’s Ideas Summit, the president has long believed in a strong partnership with India. Biden didn’t come to the conclusion “yesterday” -- he has held the view for decades.

The US President moved swiftly to build on the Indo-Pacific policy launched by his predecessor Donald Trump, pushed the Quad initiative fast forward and most importantly, he directed the American ship of state to think differently about India, be it tech transfer or building resilient supply chains or loosening America’s tight export controls for a country that’s not an ally.

Ditto for Modi and his band of ministers who are pushing to open new American doors.

Critics were quick to condemn the display, held on the front lawn of the United Nations in New York City on Wednesday. They said it distracted from allegations Modi’s administration has leaned into a Hindu nationalism that has targeted minorities, eroded democracy and shrugged off human rights.

That criticism has also been aimed at the administration of US President Joe Biden, who is set to host Modi for an official state dinner on Thursday night, one of the highest honours bestowed to visiting officials.

The two leaders are also set to hold a joint news conference that day, and Modi will address a joint session of the US Congress.

Criticism of ‘om-washing’

“Yoga means to unite. So your coming together is an expression of another form of yoga,” Modi told participants at the United Nations event on Wednesday morning, hours before he was set to be greeted by Biden at the White House.

But Ria Chakrabarty, the policy director at Hindus for Human Rights, accused the prime minister of using the event as “om-washing”, a variation on “whitewashing” that employs the mantra “om”.

She explains that cultural Hinduism — through activities like yoga, meditation and mindfulness — have a great deal of “soft power” in the West, with thousands of fans and adherents.

“Essentially what he’s doing is taking advantage of that soft power,” Chakrabarty said.

“It’s really just creating cultural soft power for him to go back to India and say, ‘Look … I’m this person who has put Hinduism on the world stage,’ even though what he’s really done is put Hindu nationalism on the world stage.”





Chakrabarty spoke on Wednesday as part of a coalition of academics, former US government officials, Indian minority groups and journalists opposing Modi’s visit. They called on the Biden administration to prioritise a laundry list of human rights allegations in his upcoming meetings with Modi.

Rights groups have documented rising abuses under Modi, who became prime minister in 2014. They include restrictions on freedom of expression, arbitrary arrests of critics, an increase in communal violence, caste- and religion-based hate crimes, and the targeting of indigenous communities.

Angana Chatterji, a co-chair of the Political Conflict, Gender and People’s Rights Initiative at the Center for Race and Gender at the University of California, Berkeley, said the US “should not bargain away human rights and democracy for political expedience”.

“Eighteen years ago, a coalition akin to the one convening today’s press conference called for the revocation of Narendra Modi’s visa,” she said.

“At that time, the United States denied Mr Modi a visa,” she said, referring to a 2005 decision to bar Modi from entering the US for failing to stop anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002 when he was the leader of the state. That restriction ended when Modi became prime minister.





A ‘defining’ relationship to curb China

But much has changed since Modi was denied the US visa, with foreign policy analysts saying both Washington and the Indian government have felt increasing unease over China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Concerns about curbing China’s power, critics say, have largely trumped the Biden administration’s vow to pursue a foreign policy led by human rights.

Speaking to a small group of reporters on Tuesday, Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called Modi’s visit “a hinge moment” in US-India relations, according to the Washington Post.

Sullivan predicted US-India ties “will be one of the defining relationships of the 21st century”.

When pressed on the issue of human rights, Sullivan said Biden has consistently stressed the need to “rally the values, norms and forces of democracy”. But, he added, Biden “has also been clear that, in that larger effort, we need constructive relationships with countries of all different traditions and backgrounds”.

Still, Zaki Barzinji, who served as a White House liaison to Muslim Americans under former President Barack Obama, said that the US-India relationship needs a different type of “turning point”.

“What our president says and does over these next few days while Prime Minister Modi is on American soil — what our elected members of Congress say and do — will directly impact the lives of millions and millions of families in Kashmir and across India for a generation,” said Barzinji, who is also the co-founder of Americans for Kashmir.





In 2019, India stripped Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region, of its limited autonomy. Since then, civil liberty groups have accused India of rolling back the rights to free media, expression and peaceful assembly and severely restricting internet access in the region.

Modi’s visit could be a crossroads, Barzinji explained, for the US government to address the crisis.

“I know the White House and Congress can give a big shining green light to Prime Minister Modi’s full-scale assault on democracy,” he said. “Or the White House and Congress can start a new conversation all together with human rights, religious pluralism and freedom at the beginning and centre of any discussion about the future of our relationship with India.”

Officials push to address India’s human rights

Despite bipartisan support for Modi’s visit, some legislators have echoed the concerns raised by human rights observers.

On Tuesday, 70 members of the US Senate and House of Representatives released a letter pushing Biden to broach the “troubling signs in India” that indicate a deteriorating human rights record.

Meanwhile, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), an independent government body, also called on Biden to speak to religious freedom concerns.

“It is vital the US government acknowledge the Indian government’s perpetration and toleration of particularly severe violations of religious freedom against its own population and urge the government to uphold its human rights obligations,” USCIRF commissioner David Curry said in a statement.





In annual reports since 2020, the commission has urged the US state department to designate India as a “country of particular concern” for religious freedom.

Most recently, it cited “laws targeting religious conversion, interfaith relationships, the wearing of hijabs and cow slaughter, which negatively impact Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Dalits and Adivasis”. It also noted the suppression of “critical voices”, particularly in minority religious communities.

Speaking as part of the coalition on Wednesday, Nadine Maenza, the former chair of USCIRF, again called on Biden to make the designation.

“This is an opportunity for President Biden to show leadership by speaking directly to Prime Minister Modi about the seriousness of the situation,” she said."

The 75th session of the UNGA in 2020 was washed out by the Covid pandemic. This year, though, the 76th UNGA afforded a chance for assorted leaders — Prime Ministers, Presidents, Emirs, Sheikhs — and assorted rulers to descend on America, to be seen, photographed, heard and video-taped, and to meet, if they could get an audience, with the new White House team of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

For India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was a much awaited and long anticipated return to some semblance of a pre-Covid level frenetic globe-trotting, sans the tight embrace, bon-homie style that led to the term “hugplomacy”.

But how did it go for Team Modi?

Well, on the face of it, it is hard to see how it could have been anything other than a success given that the official press release that contained the PMO’s own statement before the trip made it clear that expectations were modest. It was to “review” the strategic partnership, “exchange” views with the US leadership, “take stock” with QUAD partners, “consolidate” relations with partners, and “address” the UN. In short, it was all a pro-forma process with no pre-defined outcomes.

The media reactions to the visit and its aftermath followed the usual playbook. Republic TV made it sound like Modi was the only foreign dignitary to speak at the UNGA. Zee News ran with silly stories of “Josh high in Washington,” and breathless accounts of a grand welcome home. Aaj Tak was keen to emphasise how this trip had many firsts. Times Now presented it as a pivotal geopolitical moment .

If these were the only news channels you watched you’d think this was it — the grand State Visit that was going to solve every world problem from climate change to China to poverty to international conflict.

But how did other players respond? And how did the media, especially sections of social media, view it all?

Even as the Indian Prime Minister’s brand new 4,500 Crore Rupees Air India One Boeing was taking off from Delhi, the voices of human rights and religious freedoms were telling the US President’s team the issues he should take up with his Indian counterpart. On 22 September in a 90-minute webinar , under the “Congressional briefings” banner chaired by John Prabhudoss (from the Federation of Indian American Christian Organisations ), a call went out to the the White House and leaders of the US Congress to take the opportunity of the visit by Prime Minister Modi to impress upon him the need for the Indian Government to take urgent steps to protect human and civil rights and promote religious freedoms.

At the webinar, Nadine Maenza, Chair of the US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), reminded the audience of the recommendation of the Commission in two annual reports to the US State Department to regard India as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) in relation to religious freedoms. She referred her audience to Prof Angana Chatterji’s report on the situation in Assam, entitled “BREAKING WORLDS: Religion, Law and Citizenship in Majoritarian India: The Story of Assam” — a report dated September 2, which was almost prescient in light of recent events in that troubled State.

Govind Acharya of Amnesty International USA, Angna Chatterji of UC Berkeley, and Harsh Mander , currently a Fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy, and John Sifton, Asia Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch (a copy of his testimony is here ) also spoke in the webinar.

The broad but pointed message of this panel to the US team was that it was incumbent upon the Biden White House to impress upon the Indian side that a strong and stable strategic partnership can only be sustained by respect for human rights; space for the democratic values of free speech, press freedoms, and the rule of law; and the promotion of religious freedoms of minorities.

The leader of the Farmers protest, Rakesh Tikait tweeted an “open letter” to President Biden to intercede with his Indian counterpart on behalf of the agitating farmers.

The meeting at the White House with Vice-President Kamala Harris invited social media attention for the VP’s pointed mention of the importance of democratic values in both countries.

“As democracies around the world are under threat, it is imperative that we defend democratic principles and institutions within our countries. We must strengthen democracy at home and it is incumbent upon us that we protect democracy in the best interest of our people,” she said. Note that the Biden-Harris White House took charge at a particularly traumatic time because of the attempted insurrection and the dramatically violent assault on the very heart of US democracy.

The Prime Minister's meeting with President Joe Biden was a relatively tame affair with the President jocularly praising , almost tongue-in-cheek, the Indian journalists for being “well-behaved”.

Some things do not change. Even in 2019, PM Modi’s visit was presented as a major world event and a huge success but only by the Indian media for their audience back home, but it barely registered as a footnote in the US media. Then too, as Shoaib Danyal put it , “jingoism took precedence over factual reporting about the UN session”. There was barely a mention of the Modi visit in the US media save a brief mention in the context of the QUAD meeting, much to the surprise of Aaj Tak anchor Anjana Om Kashyap who tried flicking through a selection of US papers on air to spot coverage of the Modi visit.

Indeed very few Indian media outlets, if any at all, took the trouble to research what the 76th UNGA was about, and what the stand was of the other world leaders who also addressed the General Assembly. A cursory search on Google would have led even a rookie journalist to a wealth of information about the agenda, background papers, and issues before the UN.

Instead they focused exclusively and breathlessly on the 20-minute long address by PM Modi on September 25. The speech itself was as might have been expected. It sounded like a robust and combative defense of the Indian Government’s record in office in the last seven years; set against a backdrop of statements about India as an ancient democratic civilisation that inherently valued diversity, individual freedom, development, trade, openness and peace.

There was the obligatory reference to terrorism, of course, and how a certain neighbour sought to rely on terrorism rather than development to further its political aims.

Speaking in Hindi with instantaneous translation by the UN team into several languages, Modi’s speech at the UN was not the eagerly anticipated address that Indian media channels would have you believe. It was left to social media and Twitter handles to point out the preponderance of vacant seats in the assembly Hall

In the final analysis, it depends very much on the newspaper you read or the TV news you watch to get a feel for how important or influential the Indian PM’s visit to the US was. Perhaps, the truth is somewhere between the breathless fawning coverage of the TV channels that are beholden to the Government for its largesse and the somewhat cynical view expressed in this tweet thread.

Such visits by the head of the country’s government to gatherings of major world leaders are important and necessary, even if not essential — because not to make the effort to travel and be seen would be an own goal. But part of the magic is to manage expectations, say the right things at the right time, but to do so in an understated manner that does not make the audience cynical. But perhaps the most important thing is to be accessible to the world’s press.

This visit to the United States was the 6th by Mr Modi. And while there were many ‘firsts’ that his supporters claimed for it, regrettably it was not the first foreign trip in which the Indian Prime Minister gave a press conference."
358,https://time.com/6288278/modi-state-visit-biden-india-key-issues/,What to Expect from Narendra Modi's Official U.S. Visit,2023-06-20 02:12:43+00:00,"On Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden will meet India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on an official state visit in Washington D.C, which includes a South Lawn welcome, a state dinner, and an address to a joint session of Congress—an honor rarely granted to a visiting foreign leader. Modi will become just the third world leader, after France’s Emmanuel Macron and South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol, to receive this kind of diplomatic reception from President Biden.

While Modi has visited the U.S. many times—most recently for a three-day visit in September 2021, where he held a bilateral meeting with Biden—this will be the first time the Prime Minister’s trip will be categorized as the highest ranked visit according to diplomatic protocol. (The last state visit to the U.S. by an Indian leader was by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in November 2009.)

As India takes center stage as the world’s most populous country, one of the fastest growing economies, and a powerhouse for tech and innovation, the Biden Administration hopes it can court the country as a crucial ally to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

“The visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space,” the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.

Below, what to know about the upcoming visit.

What are the top priorities for Modi’s state visit?

The state visit will include conversations aimed at further cementing an already-growing defense and manufacturing relationship between the U.S. and India. More recently, Washington and New Delhi have been engaged in discussions about jointly producing jet engines, long-range artillery, and military vehicles. In May, India joined Biden’s 14-member Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which primarily aims to reduce China’s economic dominance through manufacturing, but without drawing up a formal trade agreement. Now, American company General Electric is hoping to co-produce military jets in the country, while the U.S. has increased investment in a semiconductor and chip manufacturing ecosystem set in India as a way to decrease dependence on Chinese manufacturing.

“The United States has really oriented a lot of its domestic and foreign policy around this question of, ‘how do we counter the Chinese challenge?’” says Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at Carnegie. “So if you think about semiconductors and chip manufacturing, India is a big player right now.”

In the weeks leading up to Modi’s visit, both the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have also made trips to New Delhi in an attempt to cut through the red tape to secure deals.

This week, Reuters reported that India was inching closer to buying more than two dozen U.S.-made armed drones worth $2 to $3 billion to help enhance border surveillance and improve counterterrorism intelligence operations. The development comes after Sullivan, along with India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, unveiled an ambitious roadmap for Indo-U.S. collaboration in specific high-technology areas, including semiconductors, next-generation telecommunication, artificial intelligence and defense.

For India, striking deals with the U.S. will in turn strengthen the country’s hard power capabilities and make it a hotbed for innovation. “They are hoping to get more U.S. dollars, more U.S. companies, and more U.S. entrepreneurs to make India a central part of their growth and expansion plans,” says Vaishnav.

Why do the U.S. and India want to counter China?

Experts say both countries see their strategic interests converge in countering China’s threat as it becomes more expansionist and ambitious on the global stage. For the U.S., China has increasingly become its biggest competitor in the spheres of influence, while India has been embroiled in territorial disputes in the Himalayas ever since it fought a brief war with China in 1962.

In 2020, tensions between India and China flared when Beijing became more assertive over land claims along the shared Himalayan border and an altercation between Indian and Chinese military forces in the northern Indian region of Ladakh reportedly left 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead. China’s close ties to Pakistan has also resulted in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as part of the Belt and Road Initiative and controversially passes through a section of Kashmir controlled by Islamabad, adding to India’s concerns.

By helping India build up its economic and defense capabilities, Washington hopes to coordinate with New Delhi to tackle global challenges as part of its long-term interests, says Vaishnav. “Washington is really looking to create a framework of deterrence to essentially deter Chinese expansionism, and they view India as a linchpin in this strategy,” he says.

How has the relationship between India and the U.S. changed?

Relations between India and the U.S. have changed in notable ways over the years. After independence from British rule in 1947, India was more closely aligned with Russia during the Cold War era due to U.S. distrust and estrangement over India’s nuclear program, while the U.S. had a stronger partnership with India’s rival, Pakistan.

The two countries remained “estranged democracies,” according to the former U.S. Ambassador, Dennis Kux, until the early 1990s. However, since the early 2000s, U.S. administrations from Bill Clinton to Donald Trump have worked to build a strong relationship with India, recognizing its potential to be a strategic partner in ensuring the security of the Indo-Pacific region.

In 2005, India and the U.S. signed a major nuclear deal under which India was recognized de facto as a nuclear weapons power. More recently, India’s participation in the Quad, a security alliance between the U.S. and its allies, Australia, Japan and India, has led to the country becoming a critical element of American defense strategy.

Last year, the two countries conducted joint military exercises not far from the disputed Indo-China border, and in May, joined Biden’s 14-member Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which officials and business executives hope will reduce American reliance on Chinese manufacturing for mutual benefit, including increased iPhone shipments from Indian-based factories.

But he is shunned no more. On June 22, Washington will roll out the red carpet for Modi, who will become just the third world leader (after France’s Emmanuel Macron and South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol) to be invited by President Joe Biden for a state visit and dinner, the highest of diplomatic receptions typically reserved for only the closest of allies. That Biden has chosen to fete Modi in this way is indicative of the “deep and close partnership” between their two countries, the White House said in a statement, especially on matters of foreign policy. But it is perhaps also emblematic of the growing visibility and electoral heft of the Indian American community.

“Indian Americans are a key constituency and a key vote in a number of swing states,” says Sara Sadhwani, an assistant professor of politics at Pomona College and a senior researcher at AAPI Data, which publishes demographic data and policy research on Asian Americans.

With a population of nearly 5 million, Indian Americans are the second-largest immigrant group and fastest-growing voting bloc in the U.S. today. Their impact is evident at the ballot box, where Indian Americans voted in record numbers during the 2020 presidential election. It is also becoming increasingly apparent in the halls of power, from Congress (where there are five Indian American lawmakers currently serving, up from just one a decade ago) to the White House (where Kamala Harris, who is biracial, made history as the first Vice President of Indian heritage). While every presidential contest since 2016 has featured at least one Indian American candidate, 2024 is poised to be the first race to feature at least two: Nikki Hayley, the daughter of Sikh immigrants from Punjab, and Vivek Ramaswamy, whose parents hail from Kerala.

Modi’s enduring popularity among the diaspora

The Indian American community’s political weight has not been lost on Modi, who has leveraged its influence time and again. When the Prime Minister first came to power in 2014, he was received by 20,000 spectators at a sold-out event in New York’s Madison Square Garden during a five-day visit to the U.S. It was the largest reception any foreign leader has received in the country after the Pope. “This is India’s century,” Modi declared, sending the wildly enthusiastic crowd into a frenzy.

In 2019, Modi once again received a jubilant reception with nearly 50,000 spectators at a “Howdy Modi” rally in Houston.

A survey on Indian American attitudes conducted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and YouGov in 2020 found that Indian Americans held broadly favorable views of Modi, with nearly half approving of his performance as Prime Minister. Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at Carnegie, says that this might be because the Indian diaspora sees Modi as “reclaiming India’s rightful status on the global scene.”

“India is now perceived to be both big and vital to geopolitics,” Vaishnav adds. Whether it’s hosting the G-20, being feted at the state dinner by President Biden, or even maintaining cordial relations with Vladimir Putin, he says that “many Indian diaspora members view this as a sign that India is back and experiencing a period of resurgence.”

The support for Modi comes despite the fact that while Indian Americans are hardly a monolith, they tend to vote for Democrats, rather than Republicans who more closely align with Modi’s right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party. As many as 74% of Indian American voters are thought to have backed Biden in 2020, according to a 2022 survey by AAPI Data, compared to just 15% supporting Donald Trump.

While Biden’s welcoming of Modi is widely seen in the context of Washington hoping to strike defense deals with New Delhi (most analysts tell TIME the reason for the visit can be distilled to one word—China—owing to the indispensable role of India in U.S. efforts to deter Chinese aggression), it’s also recognizing Modi’s popularity among a key American voting bloc. “In a time when the country has elections decided by four states and a margin of a few percent or less, every community really matters,” says Neil Makhija, the president of Indian American Impact advocacy group. “Ours really showed up in a significant way for [Biden] in Georgia, in Pennsylvania, in Arizona.”

Still, the Republican Party sees Indian Americans as a “natural constituency,” Vaishnav says. “They are well-off, and they’re business oriented. They care about low taxes, low regulation, and entrepreneurship, and they’re socially conservative. So I don’t think it’s a group that the Democratic Party is going to take for granted.”

A “very awkward” dilemma

Modi’s state visit also poses a strategic challenge to Biden. As a candidate, the U.S. President made defending human rights and democracy a cornerstone of his foreign policy agenda. Critics argue that his embrace of Modi, who over his two terms as Prime Minister has overseen significant democratic backsliding in India, is doing just the opposite.

The controversial Indian leader—who is poised to win his third term next year—has been accused of aggressively championing a Hindu-nationalist agenda that critics say reinvents the very idea of India as a pluralist, secular democracy to a religious, nationalist autocracy. Under Modi’s leadership, India has passed discriminatory laws that have alienated nearly 200 million Muslims; squashed dissent by jailing journalists, activists, and civil society organizations; and exercised judicial influence against his political opponents (notably, Rahul Gandhi, the de facto leader and scion of the Gandhi-Nehru family at the helm of the opposition Congress Party).

The U.S. has taken note. The State Department’s annual Religious Freedom Report, a survey of religious freedoms around the world, has expressed a number of concerns over India in recent years. It was notable that unlike last year, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made no mention of India in his speech this year, which analysts saw as a move to keep U.S.-India relations friendly ahead of Modi’s visit.

But according to Audrey Truschke, an associate professor of South Asian history at Rutgers University and a vocal critic of Modi’s Hindu nationalist base, the decision to host Modi shows that the “Biden administration does not care about human rights in India. If they did, there is absolutely no way that they would be hosting Modi right now.”

“It’s very awkward for the administration,” adds Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center think-tank in Washington, D.C. “The strategic imperatives of partnership limit the options for the administration to bring attention to this issue—especially publicly, given that this Indian government does not take kindly to any type of external criticism of its internal policies.” The top priority for the administration, he says, will be to “avoid any drama.”

While the White House may want to keep the visit as anodyne as possible, the same doesn’t appear to be the case for the Indian American community at large. In the run up to Modi’s visit, pro-Modi groups have organized “Unity” marches in nearly 20 American cities on June 18, while those opposed to Modi’s presence plan to stage a rally near the White House to coincide with his arrival on June 22.

In an open letter drafted by Hindus for Human Rights, a Washington D.C.-based advocacy group, several Indian Americans, human rights advocates, and concerned allies have also urged Biden to “push back” against the Indian government’s “escalating attacks on human rights and democracy.”

By honoring Modi, Truschke warns that the White House could inadvertently encourage communal violence within the Indian American community. “This will make Hindu nationalist groups feel even more emboldened in the U.S.,” says Truschke, who herself has been on the receiving end of threats from far-right Hindu nationalists.

In this regard, the United States and India will explore how to partner together and align our efforts to advance the development and deployment of robust DPIs, including appropriate safeguards to protect, privacy, data security and intellectual property. They will explore developing a U.S.-India Global Digital Development Partnership, which would bring together technology and resources from both countries to enable development and deployment of DPIs in developing countries.



40. The leaders are committed to pursuing ambitious efforts to strengthen Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to address shared global challenges of the 21st century. In this regard, they emphasized the need for comprehensive efforts by MDBs to evolve their vision, incentive structure, operational approaches and financial capacity so that they are better equipped to address a wide range of SDGs and trans-boundary challenges including climate change, pandemics, conflicts and fragility. Recognizing multilateral efforts in this area, the leaders acknowledged the ongoing work under the Indian presidency of the G20 on strengthening MDBs including the report of the G20 Expert Group on Strengthening MDBs. By the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi, the United States and India will work together to secure G20 commitment to create a major new dedicated pool of funds at the World Bank to deploy concessional lending for global challenges, and to enhance support for crisis response in International Development Association recipient countries.



41. The leaders reaffirmed that the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) is an important pillar of our collective and collaborative efforts to build resilience in our supply chains, harness transformations in clean energy, and accelerate progress of our economies through anti-corruption efforts, efficient tax administrative practices, and capacity building measures. The leaders welcomed the substantial conclusion of negotiations on the proposed IPEF Supply Chain Agreement and committed to working with other partners expeditiously to conclude negotiations of the agreements under the clean economy and fair economy pillars to deliver concrete benefits that enhance the economic competitiveness and prosperity of countries in the Indo-Pacific. President Biden invited India to attend the APEC Summit in San Francisco in November 2023 as a guest of the host.



42. The U.S.-India trade and investment partnership is an engine for global growth, with bilateral trade exceeding $191 billion in 2022, nearly doubling from 2014. The leaders applauded the reconvening of the U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue and CEO Forum in March in New Delhi. They encouraged respective industries to take action on the recommendations from the CEOs for greater engagement and technical cooperation to build resilient supply chains for emerging technologies, clean energy technologies, and pharmaceuticals; promote an innovative digital economy; lower barriers to trade and investment; harmonize standards and regulations wherever feasible; and work towards skilling our workforces. The leaders support continued active engagement between the U.S. Treasury Department and the Indian Ministry of Finance under the Economic and Financial Partnership dialogue. They encouraged the U.S. Federal Insurance Office and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India to advance areas of mutual interest in the insurance sector under their existing MoU framework.



43. The United States and India have also taken steps toward deepening bilateral cooperation to strengthen our economic relationship, including trade ties. Underscoring the willingness and trust of both countries in resolving trade issues, the leaders welcomed the resolution of six outstanding WTO disputes between the two countries through mutually agreed solutions as well as their understandings on market access related to certain products of significance to the bilateral trade relationship. They also looked forward to reconvening the India-U.S. Trade Policy Forum before the end of 2023 to further enhance the bilateral trade relationship by addressing trade concerns and identifying further areas for engagement. India highlighted its interest in the restoration of its status under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences program, which could be considered in relation to eligibility criteria determined by the U.S. Congress. The leaders supported intensifying the work to advance progress on issues related to the eligibility criteria. Prime Minister Modi also expressed India’s interest towards being recognized as a Trade Agreements Act-designated country by the United States to further enhance the integration of both economies and to further promote trade and investment between two countries. In this regard, the leaders welcomed the initiation of discussions between both sides at an official level on issues related to bilateral government procurement.



44. The leaders welcomed focused efforts under the re-launched U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue to expand cooperation in the areas of Talent, Innovation, and Inclusive Growth. President Biden expressed appreciation for the significant workforce development efforts undertaken by several of the Indian companies taking part in the U.S.-India CEO Forum to upskill more than 250,000 employees and promote STEM learning within local communities across the United States. Both leaders applauded the concept of an “Innovation Handshake” under the Commercial Dialogue that will lift up and connect the two sides’ dynamic startup ecosystems, address specific regulatory hurdles to cooperation, and promote further innovation and job growth, particularly in emerging technologies. The Innovation Handshake demonstrates the resolve on both sides to further bolster their shared vision of an elevated strategic technology partnership, leveraging the strength and ingenuity of their respective private sectors to identify new innovations and match them with industry requirements across the priority sectors identified under the iCET framework.



45. Recognizing the essential role that micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) play in advancing inclusive growth, expanding exports, and boosting employment across our respective cities, towns, and rural areas, the leaders welcomed plans under the Commercial Dialogue to organize a forum to promote the role and scope of MSMEs in bilateral trade and a digital commerce showcase to strengthen the engagement of women-owned and rural enterprises in particular. They commended the work of the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Indian Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, which are pursuing increased cooperation and intend to formalize their work through a MoU to support entrepreneurs and MSMEs.



46. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi again welcomed Air India’s historic agreement with Boeing to acquire more than 200 American-made aircraft. This purchase will support more than one million American jobs across 44 states and contribute to ongoing efforts to modernize the civil aviation sector in India. Boeing has announced a $100 million investment on infrastructure and programs to train pilots in India, supporting India’s need for 31,000 new pilots over the next 20 years. The leaders also welcomed Boeing’s announcement of its completion of a C-17 aftermarket support facility for MRO and a new parts logistics center in India to capture future synergies between defense and civil aviation.



Empowering Future Generations and Protecting the Health of our People



47. President Biden and Prime Minister hailed the growing bilateral education partnership between the United States and India. Indian students are on pace to soon become the largest foreign student community in the United States, with an increase of nearly 20 percent in Indian students studying in the United States last year alone. The leaders welcomed the establishment of a new Joint Task Force of the Association of American Universities and leading Indian educational institutions, including the Indian Institutes of Technology, and the nomination of councils on each side, and noted their interim recommendations for expanding research and university partnerships between the two countries.

The leaders welcomed an announcement by the U.S. Department of State that it would launch a pilot to adjudicate domestic renewals of certain petition-based temporary work visas later this year, including for Indian nationals, with the intent to implement this for an expanded pool of H1B and L visa holders in 2024 and eventually broadening the program to include other eligible categories.



49. The leaders affirmed that the movement of professional and skilled workers, students, investors and business travelers between the countries contributes immensely to enhancing bilateral economic and technological partnership. While acknowledging the important steps taken to augment processing of visa applications, they noted the pressing need to further expedite this process. The leaders also directed officials to identify additional mechanisms to facilitate travel for business, tourism, and professional and technical exchanges between the two countries.



50. Concomitant with the rapid growth in our strategic partnership and demand for travel, both sides intend to open new consulates in each other’s countries. The United States intends to initiate the process to open two new consulates in India in the cities of Bengaluru and Ahmedabad. India will take steps to operationalize its new consulate in Seattle later this year, and open two new consulates at jointly identified locations in the United States.



51. The leaders recognized the role of asocial security totalization agreement in protecting the interests of cross border workers and reaffirmed the intent to continue ongoing discussions concerning the elements required in both countries to enter into a bilateral social security totalization agreement.

They welcomed the opportunity for deeper collaboration to secure pharmaceutical supply chains. The leaders encouraged their administrations to continue their strong collaboration on pandemic preparedness, supported by epidemiology training; laboratory strengthening and point of entry surveillance; and food safety and regulation. The leaders applauded collaborations between research institutes of both countries on affordable cancer technology programs, including for the development of AI enabled diagnostic and prognosis prediction tools, and on diabetes research. The leaders committed to holding a U.S.-India Cancer Dialogue, hosted by President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot, to bring experts together from both countries to identify concrete areas of collaboration to accelerate the rate of progress against cancer. They also called for expanded collaboration on digital health platforms including responsible use of cutting-edge technologies like AI, and to explore cooperation in research and the use of traditional medicine. President Biden lauded Prime Minister Modi’s plan to eliminate tuberculosis in India by 2025, five years ahead of the target set by the UN’s sustainable development goals, hailing it as a big step forward that will inspire other countries to action.



53. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi welcomed the opportunity for deeper collaboration to secure, de-risk, and strengthen pharmaceutical supply chains, with a focus on active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials, and key vaccine input materials. They also underscored the need for strengthening global collaboration network on research and development in medical countermeasures, vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to promote access to safe, effective, and innovative medical products in an affordable manner.



54. President Biden and Prime Minister Modi committed to work toward a broader and deeper bilateral drug policy framework for the 21st century. Under this framework, both countries aspire to expand cooperation and collaboration to disrupt the illicit production and international trafficking of illicit drugs, including synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl and Amphetamine Type Stimulants and illicit use of their Precursors. Toward this end, they committed to a holistic public health partnership to prevent and treat illicit drug use, address workforce shortages and skilling requirements, and showcase a secure, resilient, reliable and growing pharmaceutical supply chain as a model for the world.



55. Prime Minister Modi conveyed his deep appreciation for the repatriation of antiquities to India by the United States. Both sides expressed strong interest in working quickly toward a Cultural Property Agreement, which would help to prevent illegal trafficking of cultural property from India and enhance cooperation on the protection and lawful exchange of cultural property.



56. The Leaders welcomed the establishment of the Tamil Studies Chair at the University of Houston and reinstating the Vivekananda Chair at the University of Chicago to further research and teaching of India’s history and culture.



57. Prime Minister Modi looked forward to the visit of President Biden to the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi in September 2023.



58. Taken together, the leaders today affirmed that this document, in its breadth and depth, represents the most expansive and comprehensive vision for progress in the history of our bilateral relationship. Still, our ambitions are to reach ever greater heights, and we commit both our governments and our peoples to this endeavor, now and into the future.

Modi's official state visit to the US at the invitation of President Joe Biden is considered crucial for both countries as the discussions are likely to focus on healthcare, technology, renewable energy, education and defence.

Pakistan Defence Minister Khwaja Asif

Asif added that ""the Indian outlook towards regional politics completely changed, because it is a Hindu nationalist government"" and this has worsened the ties between the two countries.

He, however, acknowledged that India is a big market and Pakistan is a vulnerable economy. ""Obviously, India is a very big market, over 1.3 billion people. Everywhere in the world, the other big economies will need to have them as partners. But Pakistan is not a very big economy, and [is] a vulnerable economy. All we have is a geographical location, which is strategic, which attracts, I would say, not all the good things, it sometimes attracts some things which really make us even more vulnerable,"" the Defence Minister added.

Asif added that he felt appreciation was required in Washington about Pakistan's situation. ""We should not be pushed into a situation where we have to make some very hard choices,"" he added. ""Our relationship with America for us is very valuable. It has its history. It has some disappointments, some huge disappointments, but still we value our relationship with the United States and we want that relationship to flourish,"" the minister said.

The Pakistan Minister's response comes as Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan recently said the US expects a transformational moment in India ties during Modi's trip."

Joint statements issued by the United States and India over the last several years have condemned North Korea’s missile tests, called for the Taliban to respect human rights and appealed for an end to the violence in Myanmar. But never has there been an outright mention of India’s primary adversary: China.

Yet it is China in recent years that has supplanted Pakistan as India’s main security threat. While Delhi may wish to minimize accusations that can heighten tensions with leadership in Beijing, China’s clashes with India along its border have turned the world’s two most populous countries into rivals again in the Indo-Pacific.

It is the resurgence of that rivalry — after decades of détente — that has made for a convergence of strategic interests between the United States and India.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Washington this week, with the full pomp and circumstance of a state visit that comes on the heels of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s tense trip to China, followed by President Biden’s comments on Tuesday calling Xi Jinping a “dictator.”

Neither Biden nor Modi would frame their engagement as primarily being about containing the China challenge, but the subtext is plain. Rather, officials say, it is about lifting up a rising power — the world’s largest democracy, if an imperfect one — and showcasing the momentum in the relationship based on a set of shared interests.

“This visit is not about China,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in an interview with reporters this week. “But the question of China’s role in the military domain, the technology domain, the economic domain will be on the agenda.”

A series of major announcements are expected Thursday, including a major deal to manufacture General Electric fighter-jet engines in India and a deal in which Delhi will buy General Atomics armed drones, a platform the Indians have wanted for years and which can help them detect and counter moves by China’s military.

The GE deal, anticipated to be worth billions of dollars, involves the provision of sophisticated jet engine technology that has never been shared even with treaty allies, and has the potential to bind the two countries’ defense industries for years to come.

“It’s coveted sensitive technology — something India’s been asking for, for almost two decades,” said Sameer Lalwani, a senior expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace. “If it works, it could lead to multiple future generations of jet engines. This is a way for the United States to both be a partner to and shape India’s defense innovation developments over the next 20 to 30 years.”

While the main partner is expected to be a state-owned company, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, officials say there are likely to be private-sector suppliers as India seeks to develop its domestic defense industry. The Modi government realizes that to compete with China, which is well into a decades-long military modernization campaign, it will need to figure out how to advance tech start-ups so they can design technologies at military scale.

Pulling down hurdles to tech and defense collaboration is a key theme of Modi’s visit. Administration officials, from Biden and Sullivan to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, have met with Delhi counterparts, and officials in both countries have worked to cut through licensing, export control and other barriers to cooperation.

On the technology front, another major expected announcement involves Micron Technology Inc., the biggest U.S. memory-chipmaker. The two leaders are expected to announce that the Boise, Idaho-based tech giant is building a chip assembly, testing and packaging plant in Modi’s home state of Gujarat.

The deal would represent the first major investment by an American firm as part of the administration’s “national mission on semiconductors” to rebalance supply chains away from China, which sealed itself off from the world for almost three years during the coronavirus pandemic. Significantly, Delhi is expected to finance more than half of the multibillion-dollar project, officials said, and this week authorized “production linked incentives” worth $1.34 billion.

From India’s perspective, these initiatives fulfill two broad objectives, said Arvind Subramanian, Modi’s chief economic adviser from 2014 to 2018. The GE deal, for instance, is part of a long-running effort to wean India off its reliance on Russia for military equipment, said Subramanian, now a senior fellow at Brown University.

The chip plant and defense deals serve Delhi’s goal of revitalizing a moribund manufacturing sector. To entice foreign investment, the government several years ago launched a major program of subsidies — just as investors were seeking alternative locations to China during the pandemic.

But whether these investments will pay off depends on whether India can change its regulatory culture, reform an over-intrusive state and end arbitrary enforcement of laws, Subramanian said. “It’s an open question,” he said. “It’s not a done deal.”

Meanwhile, China casts an outsize shadow on the region, with its aggressive actions against Taiwan after a visit to Taipei last August by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), its massive military modernization, and dangerous maneuvers in proximity to U.S., Australian and Canadian ships and jets in the Pacific Ocean.

India, which will host the G-20 summit of world leaders this year, aspires to great-power status in its own right. Eschewing explicit alignment with either Russia or China, it has positioned itself as a champion of the developing world.

“India is clearly in a category of its own, in terms of our alliances and partnerships in a number of ways,” said a senior U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. “I think we are like-minded on the balance of issues.”

Modi last month was warmly greeted when he visited a number of Pacific Island nations, a region in which both the United States and China are vying for influence. He flew to Papua New Guinea — a stop that was supposed to be in tandem with Biden after both leaders attended the G-7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan. But Biden canceled that leg of his trip to return to Washington to deal with a debt ceiling crisis. Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape hailed Modi as “the leader of the Global South.”

While Modi is held up as a voice of developing countries that do not wish to be forced to choose between the United States and China, he is also a lightning rod for criticism over his government’s treatment of its Muslim minority population, and crackdowns on the press and political opposition. That troubling tilt toward illiberalism is the unspoken tension in the Washington visit.

Administration officials, however, prefer to stress the strategic role India can play as a key economic and military partner in the Indo-Pacific and bulwark against China, though they rarely — if ever — in joint statements explicitly mention China.

“You hear us talking a lot about a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Ely Ratner said in an interview. “A strong India and a strong U.S.-India partnership is central to achieving that vision.” That’s why, he said, “the relationship matters.”

Officials in Washington are clear that India will never be a treaty ally in the manner of Japan or Australia. And they understand that Delhi has no intention to give up its strategic autonomy or seek to be seen as aligned with NATO and the West. Modi’s government has refused to condemn Russia for its invasion of Ukraine or join in sanctions.

What’s manifestly changed in the last decade is how India perceives China as a threat. The two countries have been fighting a bitter, bloody battle along their Himalayan border since 2020, one that has claimed 20 Indian lives.

Public opinion in India on China is the lowest it has been since the 1962 war, in which China invaded India. Delhi has banned TikTok, along with more than 100 Chinese apps. It has effectively barred Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE from its 5G networks.

Though observers are tempted to reduce the U.S.-India relationship to a shared interest in countering China — a version of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” — the U.S. investment in India does not involve any expectation that Delhi will aid Washington in defending Taiwan should China invade, administration officials said.

“We’re not making a bet on some future war and whether we’re fighting alongside each other in that war,” Sullivan said. “We’re making a bet that in a variety of areas that matter fundamentally to the economic resilience of the United States, to the success and vitality of an open technology ecosystem, to diversified and resilient supply chains — the things that are core to the Biden foreign policy, that India can play a very constructive role in those areas.”

Countering Chinese military aggression is an effort that has engaged a number of countries around the world in ways that do not involve them shooting at ships in the Taiwan Strait, officials point out.

“[T]here’s a convergence of … interests that can protect the autonomy of India while at the same time deepen the strategic partnership with the United States,” Sullivan said. “And we see no contradiction between those two things.”

In a statement, tech giant Microsoft said that its CEO, Satya Nadella, held discussion with PM Modi around the power of technology, particularly artificial intelligence, to help improve the lives of Indians.

Other CEOs present during the roundtable included Sam Altman (OpenAI), Tim Cook (Apple), and Lisa Su (AMD). Earlier, Tesla CEO Elon Musk had also met the Indian Prime Minister soon after he landed in the US.

PM Modi’s address to joint session of the Congress

Prime Minister Modi addressed a joint session of the US Congress. During his speech, PM Modi mentioned the growing Indo-US trade and economic relations and spoke on the rapid steps both countries are taking to boost strategic partnership. Here are some of the quotes from PM Modi’s speech:

Indo-US partnership

“Today, India and the US are working together in space and in the seas, in science and in semiconductors, in startups and sustainability, in tech and in trade, in farming and finance, in art and artificial intelligence.”

Climate actions

“We became the only G20 country to meet its Paris commitment. We made renewables account for over 40% of our energy sources, nine years ahead of the target of 2030. But we did not stop there. At the Glasgow Summit, I proposed Mission LiFE—Lifestyle for Environment. This is a way to make sustainability a true people’s movement.”

Women empowerment

“Today, in modern India, women are leading us to a better future. India’s vision is not just of development which benefits women, it’s of women-led development where women lead the journey of progress.”"

Star-Studded State Dinner At White House

Big names in the tech world and billionaire industrialists such as Mukesh Ambani, Google CEO Sunder Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook were among those invited to the State Dinner hosted in the honour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House on Thursday. The menu, comprising mostly vegetarian dishes, taking note of the dietary restrictions of the visiting prime minister, included marinated millets, stuffed mushrooms, grilled corn kernel salad and cardamom-infused strawberry shortcake.

More than 400 guests were invited for the dinner hosted by US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden at a specially decorated pavilion on the South Lawn of the White House.

PM Modi, Biden Welcome Deal On 'Reaper' Armed Drones

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden on Thursday announced the mega deal on the purchase of General Atomics MQ-9 ""Reaper"" armed drones by India. The move is seen as India further bolstering its national security and surveillance capabilities not only in the Indian Ocean but also along the frontier with China. The General Atomics MQ-9 ""Reaper"" can carry 500 per cent more payload and has nine times the horsepower in comparison to the earlier MQ-1 Predator. Moreover, MQ-9 UAV provides long-endurance, persistent surveillance, and strike capability for the warfighter.

“President Biden and Prime Minister Modi welcomed India’s plans to procure General Atomics MQ-9B HALE UAVs. The MQ-9Bs, which will be assembled in India, will enhance the ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) capabilities of India’s armed forces across domains,” a joint statement said.

Rare Press Meet And Question On India's Democracy

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing a press conference during his ongoing state visit to the US said democracy is in the DNA of both India and the United States. He was addressing a joint press conference with President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday. ""Democracy can deliver and when we talk about democracy, there is no discrimination on basis of caste, creed, religion,"" PM Modi said.

Responding to a question on climate change, PM Modi said, ""We do not believe in the exploitation of nature. Of all the G20 countries, India is the only country that has fulfilled all the promises made during G20 Summit. We are working to make India a green energy hub.""

Strong Stand On Terrorism

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday addressed the Joint Meeting of the US Congress where he said that there can be ""no ifs or buts"" in dealing with terrorism, seeking action against state sponsors of terrorism, in a veiled salvo at Pakistan. In his address, Prime Minister Modi emphasised that more than two decades after 9/11 and more than a decade after 26/11 in Mumbai, radicalism and terrorism still remain a pressing danger for the whole world.

""These ideologies keep taking new identities and forms, but their intentions are the same. Terrorism is an enemy of humanity and there can be no ifs or buts in dealing with it. We must overcome all such forces sponsoring and exporting terror,"" he said in his 60-minute address in English, as quoted by news agency PTI.

369,https://www.wionews.com/world/whats-special-about-pm-modis-visit-to-us-this-time-604469,What’s special about PM Modi’s visit to US this time?,,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to embark on an official state visit to the United States from June 21 to 24. This visit holds greater significance compared to his previous trips to Washington, as per diplomatic protocol.

What's special about the visit is that this time it is categorised as a state visit. Prime Minister Modi has made multiple visits to the US during his nine-year tenure. However, none of them were classified officially as state visits.

What are state visits?

As per diplomatic protocol, a state visit is the highest-ranked visit. The reverberations of this high-level visit will be seen in the grandiose with which the Indian prime minister will be received along with the diplomatic line-up during the trip.

Last visits by PM Modi

Less significant visits are categorised as official visits, official working visits, working visits, guest-of-government visits, or private visits, depending on their level of importance. These visits involve different protocols to be followed.

In 2014, the visit by Indian PM Modi to the US was categorised as a working visit. In 2016, it was a working lunch visit, and in 2017, Modi's visit to the US was labelled as an official working visit. Later, as per US State Department, when Modi visited the US in 2019, the visit was described as his participation in a rally in Houston, Texas.

On September 23, 2021, Modi landed in Washington for his three-day US visit. That visit was the first since the COVID-19 outbreak and also the first visit to the US since Biden assumed charge. During that trip, Modi had a busy schedule where he attended the Quad summit, addressed the 76th United Nations General Assembly meet along with holding a bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden.

Last state visit by Indian leader

The last state visit by an Indian leader to the US was when former prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited from November 23 to 25 in 2009.

Understanding state visits

State visits are formal visits to foreign countries led by a head of state or government, representing their sovereign authority, as per media reports. These visits are officially referred to as the ""visit of [name of state]"" rather than the ""visit of [name of leader].""

Invitations for state visits to the US are extended by the president, who serves as the head of state. As far as the duration of the state visits is concerned, they typically span a few days. One key difference in state visits is that it involves various elaborate ceremonies that are scheduled based on the visiting head of state's itinerary.

Ceremonies during state visit

In the US, these ceremonies may include a flight line ceremony upon arrival, a White House arrival ceremony with a 21-gun salute, a White House dinner, an exchange of diplomatic gifts, an invitation to stay at the Blair House (the US President's guesthouse), and flag street lining.

How state visits are different from other visits?

Not every visit by a foreign leader is classified as a state visit. State visits hold the highest ceremonial importance. At the same time, the state visit also symbolises strong bilateral relations.

Watch | UK Police seek motive for Nottingham murders, man arrested after police finds three dead × However, they are relatively rare. It is rare to maintain their prestige and symbolic significance. According to US diplomatic policy, the president can host no more than one leader from any nation once every four years.

Apart from state visits, other visits may be made by various important leaders. It can include crown princes, vice presidents, or ceremonial heads of state.

The impact of visit classification

Although state visits are ceremonially prestigious, the classification of the visit itself makes little difference in terms of actual diplomatic work. Working visits can be equally effective in fostering a healthy relationship between countries and accomplishing diplomatic goals."

Hundreds of activists are working to challenge the delicate choreography of controversial Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first state visit to the U.S. ― while risking backlash from the authoritarian strains within Modi’s movement, which are often hostile to criticism of their leader.

Modi, who arrived in the U.S. on Wednesday at President Joe Biden’s invitation, will receive a 21-gun welcome salute and a state dinner Thursday for the first time since becoming prime minister. Top lawmakers have also invited him to become the first-ever Indian leader to address two joint sessions of Congress.

The honors contrast with the treatment that U.S. critics of Modi’s rule say they are enduring: government intimidation, online trolling, legal harassment and effective bans on travel to India, where many of them still have family and friends. As Modi’s government has pressured journalists, human rights groups and opposition leaders at home, he and his allies are making it harder to draw attention to India’s alarming trajectory abroad, activists argue.

“Anyone who has roots in or ties to India is scared of the fact that a single word could result in reprisal,” said Raqib Hameed Naik, a journalist in exile in the U.S. who was born in the Indian-held portion of the disputed Kashmir region.

The challenge of questioning Modi’s movement even bedevils some of the most powerful players in the diaspora: leading Indian American politicians.

In 2019, India’s foreign minister refused to meet with Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) over her advocacy for Kashmir. Ahead of Modi’s current visit, Jayapal was the only one of five Indian Americans in Congress ― all House Democrats, who also include Ami Bera and Ro Khanna of California, Raja Krishnamoorthy of Illinois and Shri Thanedar of Michigan ― to sign a letter asking Biden to raise the issue of human rights with the prime minister.

“Elected officials are definitely reticent to make really strong remarks on India because they are afraid of this backlash,” said Ria Chakrabarty of Hindus for Human Rights.

A progressive congressional aide told HuffPost: “In some ways it’s harder to work on Modi than Palestine.”

Bera “raises human rights concerns directly in his conversations with Indian government officials,” a spokesperson wrote to HuffPost. One of the other lawmakers, who requested anonymity to protect relationships, said, “I’ll speak on human rights but didn’t think this was the right vehicle and neither did the White House.”

Modi’s critics want U.S. officials to engage with India and acknowledge its importance while urging the nation to abide by its stated commitment to democratic principles, including freedom of expression. Right now, they say, the Biden administration and legislators from both parties are giving Modi largely unadulterated praise that makes more rights violations inevitable and sustains an atmosphere of fear that hurts American citizens.

“Because there haven’t been consequences for the Indian government, they’re emboldened,” said Kiran Kaur Gill, the executive director of the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund.

According to advocates for a tougher U.S. approach to Modi, the retaliation against their work is driving some people in their movement to be less public or pull back altogether and disproportionately hurting communities who are already marginalized in India and the Indian diaspora, such as women and religious minorities. Eventually, the trend could have foreign policy ramifications, distorting America’s debate over a country that is an increasingly vital U.S. partner and a leader who seeks to grow even more powerful through a third term in office.

“There’s a desire for the U.S. and India to be stronger allies,” Gill said. “While there are obvious strategic reasons for that, that doesn’t take away from the fact that it’s still imperative to address these human rights issues, these issues of flouting democratic norms.”

Raising The Price Of Dissent

India elected Modi in 2014. His huge mandate and his pledges of rapid economic growth immediately drew international attention. But so did his disdain for dissenting voices, his promotion of Hindu nationalism in the diverse, historically secular country, and his role in huge anti-Muslim riots in 2002.

In office, Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have overseen raids on media organizations and nonprofits ― most recently the BBC ― and an increase in violence against Muslims and other Indian minorities. Additionally, the government has tightened control over Jammu and Kashmir, the country’s only Muslim-majority state, and meted out a record number of internet shutdowns while casting protesters and Modi’s political opponents as enemies of India.

“He’s a very rigid, authoritarian, communal and divisive leader who strongly believes in a no-questions-asked approach,” Naik said.

Naik has experienced how that approach is not limited to India’s borders.

After he covered Modi’s 2019 crackdown in Kashmir, Naik left for the U.S. in 2020, where he began running a hate crime tracker called Hindutva Watch. Since then, Indian authorities have contacted his parents 11 times to discuss his work, he said, in one instance summoning his father to an army camp. Former friends and colleagues stopped talking to Naik.

A year and a half ago, he received a phone call from someone claiming to be a senior police officer in India and saying he had a file on Naik, the reporter recalled. He later received a text message purportedly from a representative of India’s Intelligence Bureau asking when he was coming back to the country so the two could meet in person.

“The moment I will land in India, I’ll be in shackles,” Naik said.

“A lot of people in the diaspora who criticize Modi, they fear the same,” he continued, saying that feeling often spurs self-censorship.

India’s embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment for this article.

The Indian government can also use more subtle ways to punish critics internationally.

Many Indian Americans are worried about losing their Overseas Citizenship of India cards, a form of permanent visa. (India does not permit dual citizenship.) In 2021, the Indian government reportedly canceled OCI cards for people who supported demonstrations by farmers, and in 2019, it revoked the card from Aatish Taseer, a high-profile writer critical of Modi.

“If they can go after [Taseer], it’s a good signal,” Suchitra Vijayan, another writer, told HuffPost. “It’s almost impossible for people who are not as famous as him to actually fight …it sent such chilling shockwaves around the community.”

Rasheed Ahmed, the executive director of the Indian American Muslim Council, told HuffPost he had heard of Indian diplomats writing to individuals saying their cards needed to be reviewed.

“There is a considerable level of apprehension – beyond apprehension, fear – in the Indian Muslim community. If there is a protest, people say they don’t want to go,” Ahmed continued, noting community members’ anxieties about continued access to family members or business interests in India.

The effort to discourage criticism of Modi can blur the lines between India’s government, his political movement and his unofficial defenders.

In February, a Twitter account called @DisInfoLab attacked Sunita Viswanath, a U.S.-based activist who runs Hindus for Human Rights, as an agent of George Soros, the billionaire donor to good government watchdogs and liberal politicians who is a global bogeyman for conservatives. Earlier this month, prominent BJP operative Amit Malviya began recirculating the claim, tacking on a suggestion that Viswanath works with Indian nemesis Pakistan.

The overall environment is one of feeling watched and vulnerable, activists say, with people disturbed by Modi’s actions regularly assessing how they can safely channel their discontent ― given the potential danger that they or people close to them could face just because of something like a video of them circulating in pro-Modi WhatsApp groups.

Those feelings are amplified by signs that Modi supporters in India are cooperating with ultraconservative members of Indian immigrant communities to quash criticism, Chakrabarty noted. “People have experienced death threats from addressing quote unquote touchy issues within the diaspora,” she said, citing the example of a California state senator who sought to bar discrimination on the basis of the Hindu concept of caste. “These are pretty coordinated campaigns.”

In 2021, Vijayan’s organization, the Polis Project, worked on a conference titled Dismantling Global Hindutva that drew 1.8 million emails’ worth of complaints to universities and people involved in the project, she said, causing some participants to discuss calling the plan off for safety reasons.

“Imagine an academic conference held online and curated by predominantly American universities being intimidated in a way that they wanted to cancel,” Vijayan said.

Weathering Pro-Modi Storms

For many Modi observers, the work of boosting awareness about his policies and seeking American pressure for changes are too important to abandon.

“You cannot preempt authoritarian regimes ― you cannot stay silent because you think something might happen… I would also be very wary of just being silent,” Vijayan said.

Deepa Iyer, a longtime activist in the South Asian American community, sees a bright spot in the willingness of a broader range of groups to speak out about changes in India.

“The more people who speak out, the greater safety there is,” she said.

She and Chakrabarty noted how upper-caste Hindus are particularly conscious of their position. They may be more shielded from criticism or more focused on less visible activism, like trying to explain worrying developments to family members.

Another factor that organizers consider in community members’ willingness to speak out is whether their loved ones in India live in BJP-run states and what immigration status they hold in the U.S., Chakrabarty noted.

“We build towards this choir of voices … there’s real power when you’ve got a surge,” Iyer said.

Washington’s broader conversation about Modi echoes the discussions among activists in some ways: whether to be public or not on the issue of human rights.

Naik argued that the sense of intimidation he and other Modi critics feel shows the importance of clear U.S. action.

“This is a clear example of transnational repression,” he said, using a term the Biden administration frequently deploys in critiquing other nations’ approach to overseas critics. “They have taken action against the Chinese, they have taken action against the Iranians… unfortunately it has been the case that they only use [the relevant policies] against their adversaries.”

Biden’s team argues that private persuasion is the best way to encourage India to change course. In a call with reporters on Wednesday, a senior administration official said the president raises rights issues to Modi “with respect” and “humility,” acknowledging that the U.S. has its own shortcomings as a way to create “a dialogue based on mutual challenges rather than simply hectoring, lecturing or scolding.

“That kind of interaction, that kind of respectful approach, tends to be more effective,” the official said.

But the lack of concrete signs that Modi is easing his approach to minorities and critics leaves many observers unimpressed with that line ― and determined to keep raising the alarm despite the toll.

“If the general thinking is to address issues behind the scenes, it has clearly not worked,” Gill said.

A senior congressional aide described the letter from Jayapal and more than 70 other lawmakers as a symptom of confusion about Biden’s approach.

“There is not a clear public understanding of how the values discussion is figuring in the broader bilateral relationship with India. That’s both the U.S. administration’s fault but also the Indian government’s,” the aide said. “The internal struggle is how do you get India to move the ball on these issues… we should be talking about all of the things, and if there’s a clear sense that values is part of the broader discussion, then you’d see less of a public-facing criticism on human rights and democracy issues.”

Gill summarized the yearning for more visible action."
372,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/22/us/modi-biden-visit,Modi State Visit Modi Promotes India to Congress After Meeting With Biden,2023-06-22 00:00:00,"President Dwight D. Eisenhower, right, held a formal dinner for Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union, when the Russian premier visited the White House in 1959.

As President Biden welcomed India’s prime minister to the White House, the two leaders were looking for more than a fine vegetarian meal and a night of glitzy entertainment.

Under the guise of pomp and pageantry, state visits are a chance for presidents to push foreign dignitaries to align with American interests. They can be a way to celebrate old, ironclad alliances. And with high-profile guest lists, multicourse meals and top-flight entertainment, they are much-coveted invites in Washington.

“These are not just dinners,” said Matthew Costello, a senior historian for the White House Historical Association. “There’s a lot more that goes into them in terms of planning, in terms of invitations, and a lot is geopolitics, a lot is foreign policy.”

When President Dwight D. Eisenhower invited Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union, to the White House in 1959, he was focused on thawing Cold War tensions after the launch of Sputnik. Before President Barack Obama hosted President Xi Jinping of China, the two countries negotiated for weeks over an arms control accord for cyberspace. President Ulysses S. Grant held the first state dinner for King David Kalakaua of Hawaii to strengthen trade.

The dinners can also provide a window into the regions the United States is prioritizing — and the ones being neglected.

European and Latin American nations have received the most state dinner invitations, while sub-Saharan African and Southeast Asian nations have received the fewest, according to a study by the Center for Global Development that tracked 40 years of state visits from the Carter to Obama administrations.

Out of 160 dinners, just 15 were with guests from sub-Saharan Africa, the study found.

“To be a foreign leader and not get the state dinner, you feel snubbed,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian. “It’s often the smaller countries in the world who don’t get them, but when you’re dealing with big power players like India, it’s a must.”

The invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India was not without controversy. Mr. Biden has made the global struggle between democracy and autocracy a key part of his foreign policy, but Mr. Modi’s government has cracked down on dissent in ways that have raised fears of authoritarianism.

Still, the White House views the world’s most populous nation as a potentially welcome addition to its coalition against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as a crucial player in its growing economic competition with China.

The other nations whose leaders received the official invitation to dine with Mr. Biden — France and South Korea — have also been partners in Mr. Biden’s effort to confront Russia.

The state dinner can sometimes be a means of smoothing over hiccups among allies.

Mr. Biden hosted President Emmanuel Macron of France for the first state visit of his administration, more than a year after the two nations feuded over a deal to provide Australians with nuclear-powered submarines. Mr. Biden invited Anthony Albanese, the prime minister of Australia, for a state visit after he canceled a trip there in May because of negotiations over the debt ceiling with congressional Republicans.

“There are multiple times we see presidents using these visits to not just describe immediate concerns, but also to talk through short-term and long-term solutions,” Mr. Costello said.

Domestic politics often hang over the dinner, as well.

Julianna Smoot, Mr. Obama’s social secretary from 2010 to 2011, said she made sure to invite the often-feuding majority and minority leaders of the Senate, Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, to state dinners for a rare détente. Governors and mayors who had previously expressed support or campaigned for the president were likely to make the list. And the primary donors of presidential campaigns could expect an invitation, particularly if they had business connections to the visiting nation.

“They didn’t become donors in politics because they were slouches,” Ms. Smoot said. “A lot of them do international work and have an interest” in attending the dinner.

The prospect of strengthening political partnerships overseas and within U.S. borders was usually enough to get a quick response from invitees.

“You’re supposed to say yes,” Ms. Smoot said of responding to the invitations, “unless there’s a death in the family.”"

The prime minister of the world’s largest democracy – who has never given a press conference in his own country – was compelled to answer a question by the media in the US.

When asked by the Wall Street Journal on the alleged persecution of Muslims, human rights violations and democracy in India, Modi said, “Mujhe ashcharya ho raha hain ki log kehte hain…log kehte hain nahi, Bharat democracy hain…aur Bharat aur America, dono ke DNA mein loktantra hain.” This translates to “I am surprised that people say…it’s not that people say, India is a democracy…and both India and America have democracy in their DNA.”

On human rights and free speech, Modi said, “Bharat ke loktantrik mulyo mein koi bhed bhav nahi hain, na dharm ke aadhar par, na jaati ke aadhar par, na umar ke aadhar par…” This translates to “there is no discrimination in India’s democratic values, neither on the basis of religion, nor on the basis of caste, nor on the basis of age…”

But how has the Western media perceived Biden’s acceptance of Modi, amid widespread criticism of India’s human rights situation?

The New York Times: ‘Mark the day: Modi fielded live questions from the press’

NYT highlighted how Modi has always denied any wrongdoing, as is clearly evident from his answers on India’s human rights situation and democracy, as mentioned earlier. It also pointed out how the prime minister and his administration has been controlling the media since he took power.

“From the start of his time in office, Mr. Modi and his staff have been fastidious about controlling his message, and trying to control the media, in general. Though he loves speeches at public events, and has leaned into his monthly radio show as a way to deliver messages to the nation, any exposure to unscripted events had been a rarity before the White House event, and probably will be again afterward,” said NYT.

It also noted that Gujarat “broke into widespread riots in 2002,” and Modi “was accused of looking away – or even enabling – Hindu mobs who went on deadly rampages in Muslim neighbourhoods.”

“Mr. Modi had long rejected any wrongdoing. But he has also publicly said that his biggest failure during that time was that he could not control the media – something he has assiduously pursued since then,” it added.

The New Yorker: ‘What Joe Biden Didn’t Say to Narendra Modi’

The article noted that this meeting was a reminder of trade-offs in Biden’s foreign policy.

It said: “Modi’s visit has, predictably, called attention to his autocratic leanings at home and served as a reminder of the trade-offs inherent in Biden’s foreign policy. The former US diplomat Aaron David Miller called Biden’s embrace of Modi and the human-rights-abusing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom Biden visited last year despite having vowed as a candidate to shun and isolate him, ‘a head-exploding hypocritical pivot.'”

It further observed that “it’s far from clear whether the accommodations to Modi were worth it.” This comment was written in reference to Modi’s silence on the Russia-Ukraine war, and the fact that he “did not even acknowledge that it was Russia that started the war.”

While criticising the Indian prime minister, The New Yorker didn’t fail to point out the “perilous state of America’s own democracy.”

It defined the press conference with Modi as a “brief press-conference-that-wasn’t-a-press conference”.

Los Angeles Times: ‘Why Is Biden Silent on Modi and India’s Slide Toward Autocracy?’

“India’s democracy is in danger. There is no sound moral, political or economic case for President Biden and other democratic leaders to pretend this isn’t happening,” said Los Angeles Times, on June 20, ahead of the joint press conference of Modi and Biden.

The opinion piece further noted, “An autocratic India will be no fast friend in the struggle against autocracies. A sustainable alliance requires genuinely shared values.”

It pointed out that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is the “latest target of regime lawfare.” The opposition leader was disqualified from parliament after a two-year defamation sentence which a Gujarat court refused to stay.

He’s convicted in a case related to a speech he had given in Kolar in 2019 in which he said, “I have a question. Why do all these thieves have Modi in their names whether it is Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi or Narendra Modi? We don’t know how many more such Modis will come out.”

The article also talked about the misuse of central law enforcement agencies to crack down on politicians. Basically, as per several reports, these agencies are allegedly used to crack down on activists, journalists, and anybody who raises a voice against the ruling administration.

“The infamous Enforcement Directorate has increased investigations of political leaders by 400% since Modi came to power, with 95% of those targeted hailing from the opposition. And all this has been in service of a Hindu nationalist regime that can be menacing to minorities. Hate crimes against Muslims are up 300% since Modi came to power and new legislation threatens to disenfranchise a large percentage of the country’s 200 million Muslims,” it said.

It also noted the importance of western countries in establishing a relationship with India so that they can “decouple” their economies from China and shift industry to India.

And therefore, it spoke of hope, saying, “There is every reason to think that India could once again be a democracy that inspires the world. Its constitution remains strong, and its Supreme Court shows signs of willingness to stand up to the regime. It is governed by a highly federalized system with powerful state administrations, half of whom are not in the hands of Modi’s BJP.”

But it concluded saying, “Biden says democracy is “the single best way to realise the promise of our future. He and many other influential supporters of democracy know that India’s democracy is in danger — it’s time for them to say so loud and clear.”

Foreign Affairs: ‘The Folly of India’s Neutrality’



“In the face of Chinese aggression, New Delhi must align with Washington,” read the summary of the piece in Foreign Affairs.

In another piece by Daniel Markey, before Modi landed in the US, said that “the Biden administration, having cast itself as a vocal champion of democratic ideals, finds itself on shaky ground whenever it characterises the US’s partnership with India as one of shared values.”

“If making democratic values the cornerstone of the US-Indian relationship has always been a dubious strategy, today it is clearly doomed– because the very notion of common values has itself come to look fanciful. Ever since Narendra Modi became the Indian prime minister nine years ago, India’s status as a democracy has become increasingly suspect. The “world’s largest democracy” has seen an upsurge in violence directed at its Muslim minority, often whipped up by prominent politicians. It is trying to strip citizenship from millions of Muslim residents. It is muzzling the press and silencing opposition figures,” it said.

It noted that India and the US have a “clear, common geopolitical foe in China.” And, each understands that the other can help it win its competition against Beijing.

“For India, the United States is an attractive source of advanced technology, education, and investment. New Delhi may still have close ties with Moscow, but the uncertain quality and reliability of Russian arms mean that India is more open than ever to buying weapons from the West instead,” it added.

But what justifies US’s high tolerance for New Delhi’s behaviour [on human rights, declining democracy and press freedom]?

“Rather than considering India an ally in the fight for global democracy, it must see that India is an ally of convenience,” noted the article.

“This shift will not be easy, given that Washington has spent decades looking at New Delhi through rose-colored glasses. But the pivot will encourage both sides to understand that their relationship is ultimately transactional – and allow them to get down to business,” it said.

The Atlantic: ‘Indian Dissidents Have Had It With America Praising Modi’

The Atlantic’s Daniel Block minced no words in acknowledging the 2002 Gujarat riots and Modi’s handling of the situation when he was the chief minister of the state.

It criticised American leaders who “continue to praise New Delhi and downplay its shortcomings.”

It quoted Hartosh Singh Bal, the executive editor of The Caravan, one of the country’s few remaining independent national news outlets, as saying, “Unless they are blind, they can tell that there’s a huge difference in what a thriving democracy should be and what India is.”

The article noted the significance of international criticism. For instance, it said that “during the 2020 presidential election, both Biden and Kamala Harris criticised Indian policies toward Kashmir. Trump said that Modi was “working very hard on religious freedom.” New Delhi ended the internet shutdown 16 days after the former two politicians took office.”

On this matter, The Atlantic quoted Aakar Patel, the chair of Amnesty International India, as saying, “My speculation is that what was blocked for 17 months was lifted in less than 17 days because of what was felt to be a pressure coming in from the Democrats.”

Another journalist told the author that the US should set a positive example by “taking on Hindu nationalists in the US.”

Sudipto Mondal, the executive editor of The News Minute, said, “More than 5 million South Asians live in the US, including people who belong to low castes. They can experience oppression that mirrors what low-caste people are subjected to in India. Large numbers of South Asian Americans belonging to Hinduism’s lowest caste, for example, have reported facing caste-based employment discrimination from high-caste South Asian Americans (who constitute most of the diaspora). So far, no US state has added caste to the list of groups protected by anti-discrimination laws, but Seattle banned caste discrimination in employment, housing, and public spaces in February. California is moving forward with legislation that would do the same.”

“If Congress followed suit, Mondal believes the effects could reverberate around the world,” noted the article.

Politico: ‘Biden Is Happy to Throw Modi an Esteemed Dinner. And Bite His Lip About Human Rights.’

“Despite its wariness of Modi, the US has looked to New Delhi as a rising economic partner and a bulwark against China’s dominance in the region,” said Politico.

With India becoming the world’s most populous nation and its surging economy drawing foreign investments, the article observed that “the US feels it has no choice but continue to court him [Modi] as an essential bulwark on the far side of the globe.”

It highlighted the significance of India-US ties with respect to keep a check on China.

“India’s biggest role, the administration believes, could be to provide a check on China. India and China share a lengthy border and recent tensions. US has elevated India as part of the Quad alliance — along with Australia and Japan — to reinforce democracy’s position in the Pacific and has pushed New Delhi to act as a buffer against the economic and territorial ambitions of Xi Jinping,” it said.

However, it criticised the stance taken by US officials, who, despite knowing the deteriorating human rights situation in India, “prefer to level their criticisms behind the scenes.”

“But doing so, human rights activists argue, means offering a tacit blessing to the abuses taking place under Modi’s watch — and it forfeits an opportunity to improve the situation,” it added."

The White House has announced that President Joe Biden will host Prime Minister Modi for an official state visit to the US, which will include a state dinner on June 22.

“The visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defence, clean energy and space,” the White House said.

In a statement on PM Modi’s first state visit to US after Biden became President, the Ministry of External Affairs said, Modi and Biden will also explore ways to strengthen India-US collaboration in pluri-lateral and multilateral fora, including in the G20.

President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will host Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an Official State Visit to the United States, which will include a state dinner, on June 22, the White House has announced.

What is a State Visit?

PM Modi is scheduled to make his first state visit to the US, which is considered the highest expression of friendly bilateral ties between the two democracies. State visits are led by foreign heads of state acting in their sovereign capacity and are the highest rank in terms of diplomatic protocol.

A state visit requires a couple of days and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also expected to address a joint session of the US Congress and a state dinner at the White House.

PM Modi last visited Washington in September 2021 for the first in-person Quad Leaders Summit where he also had a bilateral meeting with President Biden. Although PM Modi has visited the US seven times since being elected, none of those visits were considered official state visits, but rather official or working visits, with most of them coinciding with his trips to the UN in New York.

PM Modi’s upcoming visit marks the first official state visit by an Indian Prime Minister since Manmohan Singh’s visit in November 2009.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the visit will underscore the growing importance of the strategic partnership between India and the US as the two nations collaborate across numerous sectors. “The leaders will have the opportunity to review strong bilateral cooperation in various areas of mutual interest, including technology, trade, industry, education, research, clean energy, defence, security, healthcare, and deepening people-to-people connections,” an official statement read.

Are All Visits by Foriegn Leader a State Visit?

No, not all visits by foreign leaders State visits in the US. According to Satow’s Diplomatic Practice (1917), State visits can only occur on the invitation of the US president, while official visits are usually made by the chief of government of a foreign state. A state banquet is held in honor of the visiting head of state, along with official public ceremonies, during their four-day stay in Washington.

US President Biden had extended an invitation to Prime Minister Modi for a State visit in February. The dates were not announced as the Prime Minister has packed domestic and international commitments along with the G20 summit.

The US Department of State website describes PM Modi’s previous visits as a “working visit” (2014), “working lunch” (2016), “official working visit” (2017), and his 2019 visit as “participated in a rally in Houston, Texas,” according to an Indian Express article.

PM Modi’s US State Visit: Eye on China, Ukraine Conflict

The White House on Thursday in a statement said US President Biden believes that America’s relationship with India is important and needs to be built. “This is a president who has had decades of experience in leader-to-leader relationships. This is an important relationship as we speak about the Indo-Pacific, as we talk about how to move forward in that region,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One as Biden headed to New York.

As China continues to increase its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region, the US, India, and other world powers have emphasized the importance of maintaining a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. China’s claim to almost all of the disputed South China Sea is disputed by Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and has led to the construction of artificial islands and military installations by Beijing. Additionally, China has territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea. China and its diplomats have criticised the Indo-Pacific concept from the outset, asserting that it is aimed at containing Beijing.

Speaking on “clear differences” between the US and India when it comes to Russia aggression and Ukraine conflict, the official said, “As we do with other nations around the world, we regularly engage with Indian government officials at senior levels on human rights concerns, including freedom of religion or belief. That is something that the president regularly does. We encourage all countries to uphold their human rights obligations, and commitments, and to work towards building inclusive societies.”

Others have viewed the State Visit is a big diplomatic gesture for the United States. “India was last honoured with a State Visit in 2009. That PM Modi is being honoured with only the third State Visit of the Biden Administration shows the respect and affection the American people have for a rising India,” Atul Keshap, the president of the US-India Business Council told PTI.

In response to China’s growing economic and military power, the US has strengthened its partnership with India to counter Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific and South Pacific regions. “The US recognizes the strategic importance of supporting India’s global rise. We see this in the Quad and in India’s Presidency of the G-20. This represents a larger vision of a cohesive US-Indo Pacific strategy that requires both countries to come closer together and overcome longstanding obstacles,” a person familiar with the matter told the news agency."

This observation is also being seen by diplomats as a significant marker of PM Modi’s visit being fruitful and successful.

New Delhi

Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded his State visit to the United States, with his “hands full of strategic gains”. While President Joe Biden and PM Modi in the joint statement issued after the bilateral meeting on Thursday categorically sent out a stern message to China over its belligerence and aggressive behaviour, the two leaders also called out cross-border terrorism in a clear signal to Pakistan. “That the joint statement underlined the need to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity of states should also be seen as a strong message to China in the context of its aggression at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh,” a diplomatic source told The Sunday Guardian.

“Biden and Modi discussed the China factor vis-à-vis Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh during their talks in Washington. Those raising doubt over this are absolutely wrong. They discussed the PLA’s misdeeds along the LAC. The joint statement is self-explanatory for that,” a source claimed, describing it as a diplomatic victory for the Indian side.

The Indian diplomats who have been privy to meetings and interactions in Washington say that it is also a big diplomatic triumph and gain for India that Biden defended calling Chinese President Xi Jinping a “dictator” during a joint press conference with PM Modi. Biden said his blunt statements about China are “just not something I’m going to change very much”.

Biden and Modi emphasised the importance of “rules-based international order”, saying “the contemporary global order has been built on principles of the UN Charter, international law, and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.” “The United States and India reaffirmed their resolve to counter any attempts to unilaterally subvert the multilateral system.” The diplomats here in New Delhi ask, “Do we need more evidence after these observations in the joint statement that show that China has been given a sufficient dose of message for its aggression at LAC?” The two leaders “reiterated their enduring commitment to a free, open, inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous India-Pacific region with respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, and international law,” while expressing “concern over coercive actions and rising tensions” and opposition to “destabilizing or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force.” Modi and Biden “emphasized the importance of adherence to international law, particularly as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the maintenance of freedom of navigation and overflight, in addressing challenges to the maritime rules-based order, including in the East and South China Seas.” “This is again another set of strong messages for China in the joint statement,” a diplomat said, analysing the bilateral document.

Addressing the Indian diaspora, PM Modi also separately sent a strong signal to China from the soil of the US, saying “The dark clouds of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo-Pacific. The stability of the region has become one of the central concerns of our partnership.” Diplomats say that it was a message for Biden as well. “Modi sought to suggest that India is ready to be its partner in countering China in the Indo-Pacific, and the US must also be ready to address its concerns along its northeast borders amid Chinese illegal activities,” a diplomatic official explained.

In what is being counted as another major strategic gain for India, PM Modi brought the US into the India matrix, as a result of which the Biden administration agreed to work with India in space, semiconductors, farming, artificial intelligence, energy and education, healthcare and humanitarian efforts. The joint US-India statement also said, “Biden and Modi strongly condemned cross-border terrorism, the use of terrorist proxies and called on Pakistan to take immediate action to ensure that no territory under its control is used for launching terrorist attacks”. Sources see it as another diplomatic achievement for India that Pakistan was slammed by both leaders. Pakistan was obviously rattled by the statement, as was evident from a quick angry reaction from Islamabad. Pakistan’s foreign ministry criticised US and India, saying the joint US-India statement was “unwarranted, one-sided, and misleading”. “The reference to Islamabad in it was contrary to diplomatic norms,” it said.

Sources who are in close contact with diplomats in Beijing told The Sunday Guardian that the joint statement has sent shockwaves across the power corridors in China as well. “The Chinese government is expected to come up with a terse reaction sooner or later,” said an official. India and the US affirming their vision of being among the closest partners in the world will also not go down well with China.

On the issue of Afghanistan, President Biden reaffirmed India’s stand. He stressed the need for the formation of an inclusive political structure in Kabul. The joint statement said Biden and Modi expressed commitment to continue close consultations on the situation in Afghanistan. “The leaders emphasised the importance of formation of an inclusive political structure and called on the Taliban to respect the human rights of all Afghans, including women and girls, and to respect freedom of movement,” the statement reads.

Modi and Biden urged the Taliban to abide by UNSC Resolution 2593, which demands that Afghan territory should never be used to threaten or attack any country, shelter or train terrorists, or plan or finance terrorist attacks. “Pakistan must be jittery over the statement on Afghanistan, as it underlines the importance of India’s views about and role in the trouble-torn country,” a source said.

Biden made clear that he sees India as vital to helping preserve the Western-led global international order, a set of rules-based principles and values that China is seeking to challenge. This observation is also being seen by diplomats as a significant marker of Modi’s visit being fruitful and successful in terms of strategic gains and deepening of US-India strategic ties."

NEW YORK/NEW DELHI, June 20 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in the United States on Tuesday for a state visit that has been projected as a milestone in ties between the two countries that would deepen and diversify their partnership.

Modi has been to the U.S. five times since becoming prime minister in 2014, but his visit until Saturday will be his first with the full diplomatic status of a state visit.

It also marks only the third state visit of Joe Biden's presidency and the third by an Indian leader to the U.S., a sign of the strengthening bond between Washington and New Delhi and the distance they have traveled since being on opposite sides of the Cold War.

Modi landed on Tuesday afternoon in New York, where he has business meetings and will mark International Day of Yoga on Wednesday before heading to Washington. There he has a private dinner with Biden on Wednesday, followed by talks at the White House and a state dinner on Thursday.

The visit is expected to see the two countries expand cooperation in the defense industry and high-tech sectors, with India getting access to critical American technologies that Washington rarely shares with non-allies.

""This special invitation is a reflection of the vigor and vitality of the partnership between our democracies,"" Modi said in a statement before departure.

""I will also meet some of the leading CEOs to discuss opportunities for elevating our trade and investment relationship and for building resilient global supply chains.""

Modi met on Tuesday with Tesla TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk, who was to brief him on plans to set up an electric vehicle manufacturing base in India, a source with direct knowledge of the arrangement told Reuters.

""It was excellent and a very good conversation,"" Musk said after meeting Modi, adding he planned to visit India next year.

""I am confident Tesla will be in India and will do so as soon as humanly possible,"" Musk said when asked by reporters about a timeline.

Tesla has had discussions with the Indian government about incentives for car and battery manufacturing and proposed establishing a factory in India to build electric vehicles, Reuters reported in May.

Musk is also the executive chairman of Twitter, which has had run-ins with Modi's government.

Last week, Twitter's co-founder Jack Dorsey said New Delhi threatened to shut it down in India unless the social network complied with orders to restrict accounts critical of the handling of farmer protests, a charge Modi's government called an ""outright lie"".

VITAL PARTNER

The U.S. sees India as a vital partner in its efforts to push back against China's expanding influence worldwide, although some analysts question India's willingness to stand up collectively to Beijing over issues such as Taiwan. Washington is also concerned about India's unwillingness to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

U.S. officials nevertheless see a stronger India that can defend its own interests and contribute to regional security in the Indo-Pacific as good for the United States.

U.S. lawmakers invited Modi to address a joint meeting of Congress. It will be Modi's second such address, a rare honor for a leader once denied a visa to enter the United States over human rights concerns.

Dozens of Biden's fellow Democrats on Tuesday urged him to raise human rights with Modi. The lawmakers said they were concerned about religious intolerance, press freedom, internet access and the targeting of civil society groups.

Differences persist between Washington and New Delhi over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. India has not condemned Russia and urged both sides to resolve their differences through diplomacy.

India remains dependent on old friend Moscow for its defense needs and has sharply increased its imports of cheap Russian oil, frustrating the West.

Asked by the Wall Street Journal about U.S. criticism of India for not taking a more forceful stance against Russia over Ukraine, Modi said: ""I don't think this type of perception is widespread in the U.S.""

""I think India’s position is well known and well understood in the entire world. The world has full confidence that India’s top-most priority is peace,"" he said in the interview published on Tuesday.

381,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-24/modi-biden-white-house-india-democracy-press-freedom,News Analysis: The inconvenient truth that haunted Indian Prime Minister Modi’s White House visit,2023-06-24 00:00:00,"President Biden welcomed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House on Thursday despite the Hindu nationalist’s troubling record on religious and free speech rights.

Over the course of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s extravagant three-day state visit to Washington, which featured a tented dinner on the South Lawn and a rare joint address to Congress, he and President Biden frequently spoke of their nations’ shared democratic values.

But that lofty rhetoric papered over the reality that in India, the hugely popular Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have advanced policies that discriminate against Muslims, Christians and other religious minorities and limit freedom of speech and the press.

At the White House on Thursday, Modi offered a rare response to a reporter’s question about his government’s handling of religious minorities and free speech amid concerns about the erosion of human rights in India.

“We have always proved that democracy can deliver. And when I say deliver, this is regardless of caste, creed, religion, gender,” Modi said. “There’s absolutely no space for discrimination.”

Foreign policy experts, democracy advocates, Indian dissidents and even the U.S. government disagree with his assessment. The State Department’s Office of International Religious Freedom has accused Modi’s government of overseeing arbitrary killings, restrictions on freedom of expression and the media, and violence targeting religious minorities.



Human rights groups have accused his government of undermining democracy, including by passing a citizenship law that discriminates based on religion and revoking the special autonomous status granted to India’s only Muslim-majority territory, Jammu and Kashmir. In April, top opposition leader and vocal Modi critic Rahul Gandhi was expelled from parliament after a court convicted him of defamation for mocking Modi in an election speech.

India has also become an especially difficult place to be a reporter. The nation’s ranking has slipped to No. 161 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, a list compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Afghanistan, Venezuela and South Sudan rank higher.

In February, Indian tax authorities raided local BBC offices weeks after the British broadcaster aired a documentary on Modi’s role in anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002, when he was the state’s chief minister. The government attempted to ban the documentary, labeling it “hostile propaganda and anti-India garbage.”

I know a bit about the anxieties of reporting in Modi’s India. As a reporter for BBC News in 2019, I covered his reelection campaign.

Before traveling to New Delhi, I was summoned to the Indian Embassy in Washington, where I sat down for chai with an official from the BJP, Modi’s party, who quizzed me on my family’s background and my plans in India.

I recounted my father’s journey from southern India’s Chennai, then known as Madras, to the U.S. in 1965, his life in Chicago as a doctor and my work as a journalist.

I didn’t tell him I planned to travel to Assam state’s border with Bangladesh to interview some of the millions of Muslims who would be rendered stateless under a citizenship law that would pass in Modi’s second term. I left out my plans to write about the similarities between Modi’s policies and those of then-President Trump.

That reporting led to an onslaught of hate mail and social media harassment, but I was able to return home. The same can’t be said for the Indian journalists who have been detained or bullied for scrutinizing the BJP.

Last year, 10 human rights and democracy organizations called out Modi’s government for targeting journalists, saying it had “emboldened Hindu nationalists to threaten, harass, and abuse journalists critical of the Indian government, both online and offline, with impunity.”

“This government has employed a range of tactics to chill free expression,” said Nadine Farid Johnson of PEN America, a nonprofit organization that advocates for free expression.

She pointed to the Indian government’s more recent effort to purge textbooks of references to the Muslim Mughal dynasty, the nation’s founding as a secular republic and Gujarat state’s anti-Muslim violence on Modi’s watch.

“It actually mirrors what we’re seeing here in the U.S. — these legislative efforts that have used government power to censor the diversity and complexity of our own country’s history — something we’ve seen the [Biden] administration speak out against,” Johnson said.

For Biden, the focus on shared democratic values was an awkward feature of Modi’s visit. Critics say his warm welcome of Modi undermines his messages about the threats to democracy posed by Trump, his 2020 — and potentially 2024 — Republican opponent.

At Modi’s welcoming ceremony Thursday, Biden made oblique references to human rights, hailing freedom of expression and religious pluralism as “core principles” for both countries. At a news conference that day, the president said universal human rights faced challenges “in each of our countries” but remained vital to both nations’ success. When asked by a reporter about the criticism that his administration was overlooking India’s crackdown on dissent, Biden said the two leaders had a “good discussion” about democratic values.

Politics Kamala Harris presses India’s Modi gently on human rights in historic meeting Vice President Kamala Harris invoked familial ties to India as she pressed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on human rights in a departure from the Trump administration.

The administration’s feting of Modi stretched into Friday at the State Department, where Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken hosted a luncheon in the Indian leader’s honor. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi nibbled on samosas as Harris and Blinken praised the U.S.-India partnership.

“Both countries wear the democracy label on their sleeves,” said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. “It’s a challenge for the administration, because they would like to be able to use that democracy story in India as a way of underscoring the importance of U.S.-China competition and working with like-minded democracies to counter China — but they really can’t because of the democracy struggles in India.”

The U.S. should also acknowledge its own struggles with democracy, he added, pointing to the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

“Even if the scale of the democratic backsliding in India is significantly higher than in the United States, I think the objective for the administration would be not to make it seem like it’s lecturing India,” Kugelman said. “That’s a point of sensitivity in New Delhi and among Indians on the whole — that the U.S. is a hypocrite.”

Biden administration officials have made clear that Washington’s economic and security partnership with New Delhi outweighs most other considerations. The U.S. holds more military exercises with India than with any other country, according to the State Department. And Washington became New Delhi’s largest trading partner in the 2022-23 fiscal year.

Biden’s national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, called the deepening of ties with India a “hinge moment in geopolitics,” and said he didn’t think Modi’s lavish visit undercut the president’s broader narrative of a values-based foreign policy.

“We are dealing with the gathering and march of autocratic forces in ways that are not in the United States’ national interest, and ... we do need to rally the values, norms and forces of democracy to push back against that,” he told a group of reporters Tuesday. “And that is a point the president has made consistently since he came into office. But he has also been clear that in that larger effort, we need constructive relationships with countries of all different traditions and backgrounds.”

Though Biden had vowed the U.S. would be a leading voice in the battle between autocracy and democracy, his foreign policy promises have crashed into the realities of the presidency. The White House has worked to maintain close relations with other heavy-handed foreign leaders with questionable records on democracy and human rights: Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mexico’s Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu.

Most Indians recognize that the U.S. and India share economic and security interests, said Sushant Singh, a journalist and senior fellow at India’s Center for Policy Research. The welcome Modi received in Washington will only strengthen his hand at home, Singh added.

“Mr. Modi’s welcome by Mr. Biden and the personal praise for him allows him to leave a much stronger imprint on India, and in a certain sense change India’s course of the last 75 years, which was a secular, liberal, progressive democracy.”

The global rehabilitation of Modi’s image has been swift. The Indian leader was denied a U.S. visa in 2005, three years after the deadly riots in his home state left more than 1,000 people dead — most of them Muslims. (Modi has rejected allegations that he was involved, and a panel of India’s Supreme Court said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him).

But Modi’s rise to Indian prime minister in 2014 and the subsequent years have seen U.S. presidents and officials and other Western leaders court him. In April, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo called Modi a “visionary” after she visited India.

After a planned meeting of the so-called Quad alliance in Sydney was scrapped in May so that Biden could continue talks with congressional Republicans over the U.S. debt ceiling, the event transformed into a Modi spectacle. Before a crowd of thousands, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese likened the Indian leader to Bruce Springsteen, while a plane spelled out “Welcome Modi” in the sky.

Modi’s state visit — which also featured a private dinner with the Bidens — was a clear signal of New Delhi’s global clout. He will have a chance to showcase his success again when his country, which just overtook China as the world’s most populous nation, hosts the Group of 20 summit in New Delhi in September. Like Biden, Modi faces a reelection bid next year.

The spectacle in D.C. has emboldened Hindu nationalists, Singh noted.

On Thursday, former President Obama told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that it was “appropriate” for Biden to challenge Modi on protecting the rights of minority groups in India.

After one Twitter user then called for Obama’s arrest for “hurting sentiment,” the chief minister of the Indian state of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, responded by referring to the former president’s middle name, Hussein, falsely suggesting that Obama is Muslim.

India should focus on “taking care” of its own Muslims first, Sarma implied.

“There are many Hussain Obama[s] in India itself. We should prioritize taking care of them before considering going to Washington,” he tweeted. “The Assam police will act according to our own priorities.”

(Sarahbeth Maney/Getty Images)

As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits the United States and addresses U.S. Congress this week, Americans generally regard India favorably. But many have never heard of Modi, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted March 20-26, 2023. Those who have heard of the Indian leader tend to lack confidence in him.

How we did this Ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States in June 2023, Pew Research Center analyzed Americans’ knowledge and views of India and its leader. For this analysis, we surveyed 3,576 U.S. adults from from March 20 to March 26, 2023. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.

About half of U.S. adults (51%) have a favorable view of India, while a somewhat smaller share (44%) have an unfavorable view.

Attitudes vary slightly by educational attainment: 55% of Americans with a bachelor’s degree or higher view India positively, while 50% of those with some college or less education say the same.

Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are also somewhat more likely than their Republican and Republican-leaning counterparts to see India favorably (56% vs. 48%).

Looking at India’s position globally, most U.S. adults (64%) believe the country’s influence in the world has stayed about the same in recent years. Another 23% say India’s influence has gotten stronger, while 11% say its influence has weakened.

Men are more likely than women to say India’s influence has been getting stronger, as are those with a bachelor’s degree or more education when compared with those without a college degree. (Men in the U.S. were also more likely than women to answer the question.) U.S. adults who closely follow international news are also more likely than those who follow it less closely to see India as a growing power.

When it comes to India’s prime minister, a substantial share in the U.S. (40%) say they have never heard of him. Americans under 30 are particularly likely to say they do not know who Modi is (59%). In comparison, 28% of U.S. adults 65 and older say the same. Adults with less education are also more likely than those with higher levels of education to have never heard of Modi.

For those who have heard of Modi, the prevailing sentiment is negative: 37% have little or no confidence in his ability to do the right thing regarding world affairs, compared with 21% who are confident in him.

Americans are also largely unfamiliar with the Indian flag, according to the results of a 2022 Center quiz that gauged Americans’ knowledge of international affairs. When presented with a picture of India’s flag, only 41% of Americans correctly identified the country it represents.

Americans with a bachelor’s degree or higher were more likely than those with less education to correctly attribute the flag to India, as were younger Americans when compared with their older counterparts. Liberal Democrats were also 16 percentage points more likely than conservative Republicans to correctly identify the Indian flag.

This special invitation is a reflection of the vigour and vitality of the partnership between our democracies.

I will commence my visit in New York, where I will celebrate the International Day of Yoga on June 21 at the United Nations Headquarters with the UN leadership and members of the international community. I look forward to this special celebration at the very location that supported India’s proposal in December 2014 to recognize an International Day of Yoga.

I will thereafter travel to Washington D.C. President Biden and I have had the opportunity to meet several times since my last Official Visit to the USA in September 2021. This visit will be an opportunity to enrich the depth and diversity of our partnership.

India-US ties are multifaceted, with deepening engagements across sectors. USA is India’s largest trade partner in goods and services. We collaborate closely in science & technology, education, health, defence and security fields. The initiative on Critical & Emerging Technologies has added new dimensions and widened collaboration to defence industrial cooperation, space, telecom, quantum, Artificial Intelligence and biotech sectors. Our two countries are also collaborating to further our shared vision of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.

My discussions with President Biden and other senior US leaders will provide an opportunity to consolidate our bilateral cooperation as well as in plurilateral forums such as G20, Quad and IPEF.

I will also have the pleasure of joining President Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden for the State Banquet along with a number of dignitaries.

The US Congress has always provided strong bi-partisan support to India-US ties. During my visit, I will address a Joint Session of the US Congress at the invitation of Congressional leadership.

Strong people-to-people linkages have been instrumental in developing the trust between our countries. I look forward to meeting the vibrant Indian-American community that represents the best of our societies. I will also meet some of the leading CEOs to discuss opportunities for elevating our trade and investment relationship and for building resilient global supply chains.

I am confident that my visit to the US will reinforce our ties based on shared values of democracy, diversity and freedom. Together we stand stronger in meeting the shared global challenges.

I will travel to Cairo from Washington D.C. at the invitation of President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. I am excited to pay a State Visit to a close and friendly country for the first time.

We had the pleasure of receiving President Sisi as the Chief Guest at our Republic Day celebrations this year. These two visits in the span of a few months is a reflection of our rapidly evolving partnership with Egypt, which was elevated to a ‘Strategic Partnership’ during President Sisi’s visit.

I look forward to my discussions with President Sisi and senior members of the Egyptian Government to impart further momentum to our civilizational and multi-faceted partnership. I will also have the opportunity to interact with the vibrant Indian diaspora in Egypt."

The visit will put on full display the ""deep and close partnership"" between the U.S. and India, the White House said, despite concerns India's democratic principles have eroded under Modi's leadership.

The relationship has been described by Biden as ""one of the most important"" of this century as the U.S. rebalances its foreign policy focus to the Indo-Pacific in the face of an increasingly aggressive China. Just ahead of Modi's visit, President Biden suggested Chinese President Xi Jinping was a ""dictator.""

""There's a strategic imperative in the region,"" Tanvi Madan, the director of The India Project at the Brookings Institution, told ABC News. ""Multiple administrations have seen India as a geopolitical counterbalance, an economic alternative and a democratic contrast to China.""

The two leaders greeted each other warmly on the South Lawn in a welcome featuring marching bands and honor guards, despite rainy weather. Vice President Kamala Harris, the first person of Indian descent in her role, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were also there to greet the prime minister.

""The challenges and opportunities facing the world in this century require that India and the United States work and lead together, and we are,"" Biden said.

Modi said the partnership between the U.S. and India ""will be instrumental in enhancing the strength of the whole world.""

Biden and Modi met in the Oval Office and appeared side by side at a brief news conference in the East Room, a rarity for Modi who only held his first-ever press conference in India in 2019 after being in power for five years.

Modi also appeared on Capitol Hill to address a joint meeting of Congress before a state dinner at the White House Thursday night.

The prime minister received a standing ovation as he entered the chamber to chants of ""Modi, Modi"" from members, though a handful of progressive Democrats boycotted the speech, citing reports of human rights abuses.

Modi took a moment to note those in the chamber who have Indian roots, turning to point to Vice President Harris seated behind him whom he celebrated as having ""made history.""

""We come from different circumstances and history, but we are united by a common vision. And, by a common destiny,"" Modi told lawmakers in closing. ""When our partnership progresses, economic resilience increases, innovation grows, science flourishes, knowledge advances, humanity benefits, our seas and skies are safer, democracy will shine brighter and the world will be a better place.""

About 400 guests are expected to attend the dinner, the White House said, which will include a plant-based menu and a mixture of American and Indian decor. There will be performances from American violinist Joshua Bell and from Penn Masala, a South Asian a cappella group from the University of Pennsylvania.

Modi's trip to Washington, though, isn't without controversy as the prime minister's been criticized for a rise in violence against religious minorities as well as a crackdown on the press and dissenters.

Some democracy watchdogs have downgraded India's rating in recent years. The U.S.-based Freedom House rated India as ""partly free"" in its 2023 report, and the Sweden-based Varieties of Democracy called India an ""electoral autocracy.""

""He's got a mixed record,"" Richard Rossow, chair U.S.-India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said of Modi. ""We do see at times he feels politically weak domestically, he's initiated steps that directly or indirectly seem to stoke the fears of religious intolerance by him and his party. And we've also seen crackdown on civil society to some extent.""

Human rights advocates and at least 70 lawmakers called on Biden to directly address human rights violations during Modi's visit. Experts told ABC News any human rights or democratic issues will likely be taken up in private between the two leaders.

Biden was asked during the news conference about those who've criticized his administration as overlooking such human rights concerns in hosting Modi.

""Look, the prime minister and I had a good discussion about democratic values,"" Biden responded. That's the nature of our relationship, we're straightforward with each other and we respect each other.""

""I believe that we believe in the dignity of every citizen and it is in America's and I believe in India's DNA that the whole world, the whole world has a stake in our success,"" the president continued. ""Both of us, in maintaining our democracies, make us appealing partners and enables us to expand democratic institutions across, around the world.""

Modi, meanwhile, sidestepped a question on recent allegations of human right abuses as he claimed in India ""there's absolutely no discrimination, neither on basis of cast, creed, or age, or any kind of geographic location.""

""I'm actually really surprised that people say so,"" the prime minister said as he defended his government. ""Indeed, India is a democracy ... democracy is in our DNA. democracy is our spirit. democracy runs in our veins. We live democracy.""

Also at issue during the trip was Russia. India, which has long relied on Russian oil and weapons, has avoided outrightly condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

But experts noted Modi's slight change in tone when it comes to Russia's invasion, such as his recent statements on the importance of territorial integrity and sovereignty.

""Both Washington and New Delhi understand that they will not necessarily see eye to eye on Russia,"" Kenneth Juster, who served as the U.S. ambassador to India during the Trump administration, told ABC News. ""But they can discuss that issue candidly with each other, and it is not going to have a negative impact on their broader strategic partnership.""

A senior Biden official said the White House would ""engage actively"" with India on issues related to Russia and Ukraine, specifically India's efforts to diversify away from Russian military equipment.

Talks between Biden and Modi also included trade, climate and space.

The two leaders announced a number of new commitments, including a joint space mission as well as various investments in technology, defense and clean energy.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking to the U.S.-India Business Council last week, touted trade between the two nations reached a record $191 billion. Blinken noted the U.S. is India's largest trading partner, and Indian companies invested more than $40 billion in the U.S. in IT, pharmaceuticals and more.

Though Juster said be believed there is still more work to do to advance on the trade front ahead of the state visit.

""For the world's largest economy, the United States, and its fifth largest economy, India, I believe that their bilateral trade relationship does not fulfill all of its potential. I am hoping that the two countries can continue to advance their trade and investment relationship both bilaterally and regionally, because economic issues are so important in the Indo-Pacific and China has a robust economic strategy for the region,"" he said.

Prior to landing in Washington, Modi met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk as well as other business leaders and health care experts.

He also marked International Day of Yoga by participating in a group session on the lawn of the United Nations headquarters.

The last time Modi visited the U.S. was in 2019, when he appeared alongside former President Donald Trump at a ""Howdy Modi"" rally in Texas attended by tens of thousands of people.

This reaction was expected after India signed several defence and commercial pacts with the US during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s official state visit.

PM Modi’s visit to the United States has been a huge success in bolstering defence ties and has set up a roadmap for industrial-defence cooperation between both countries. This seems to have provoked and bewildered China due to which it is putting out rattled responses especially at a time its ties with Washington are troubled.

Beijing’s mouthpiece detailing India’s ties with Washington expressed concern over the meeting between PM Modi and US President Joe Biden. It feared that India might overtake China in the fields of tech and innovation after having surpassed China as the world’s most populous country and could significantly threaten China’s expanding influence in the Indo pacific.

In a sharp reaction to Modi’s visit, PRC’s top diplomat Wang Yi snapped at the Biden administration for trying to push India against China and ramping up efforts to arrest China’s economic progress. Yi warned that such efforts are bound to fail and that all efforts by Washington to expand its footprint in Asia would fail. The Chinese diplomat said that while US geopolitical aspirations are very difficult to read, its rigorous efforts in ramping up, arming and building economic ties with countries to slow down Chinese economic development are bound to fail.

However, Yi said that while India has the right to choose alliances and policies favourable to its own interests, the US is guided by reckless and selfish interests and is essentially making India a part of its ploy to contain China. Yi Insisted that the US is doomed to fail stating that China’s position in the global supply chain cannot be replaced even by a steadily and rapidly advancing India. Though the Indian economy is expanding, it is still dependent on the Chinese economy as evident in the cross-border trade which reached a whopping $135.98 billion in 2022.

China Rattled by India’s Rise

India’s rise to power in recent times has China worried and sees it as a direct threat. China’s rattled response to PM Modi’s visit to the US reaffirms its hegemonic worldview which states that countries should act in ways conducive to its interest in order to maintain mutual peace, cooperation and stability in the region. This is a reflection of the Chinese Communist Party’s worldview.

India recently joined the 14-member Indo-Pacific Economic Framework primarily in a bid to reduce the economic dependence on China, directly aiming to reduce the Chinese influence in various sectors, especially manufacturing. US plans to enable a manufacturing hub for semiconductors in countries like Vietnam and India have shaken China’s government and the CCP, which are now scrambling for solutions. This would be difficult, especially due to the havoc caused by the Covid19 pandemic, the debt and the economic crisis that it faces now.

India’s rise as an upcoming power makes it a big player for Washington. India is securing defence deals including 2 dozen US-made armed drones, that will help in surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The two countries have outlined a new roadmap for collaboration between India and the US in the fields of telecommunication, defence, Intelligence, Counter Intelligence and AI.

Even with the cloaked diplomacy that is prevalent in International Relations, the message is very much clear, which essentially is to “Tame the Dragon”. Analysts also opine that these deals might be a strategy by the West to sell their weapons to New Delhi and slowly wean off the Russian influence on Indian military hardware and spare parts. Many are critical of the deals with the US, stating that it could make India dependent on the West and that the Indo-US relation can never replace the comprehensive and trustworthy India-Russia partnership. Whatever the agenda of the US and the West is, it is evident that the rise of India as a global power is imminent and the world has to embrace it to restrain hegemonic forces."

The man, who was identified as Raghavendra, said that he was a fan of PM Modi and that he wanted to show his support for him.

""I took this plate back in 2016, November. Narendra Modi is an inspiration to me. He inspires me to do something good for the nation, for society, for the world. PM Modi is coming here so I'm eagerly waiting to welcome him,"" he said.

The car number plate was a custom-made plate, and it cost Raghavendra around $1,000 to get it. He said that he was proud to have the plate and that he hoped that PM Modi would see it when he visited the US.

The news of the car number plate went viral on social media, and many people reacted to it. Some people praised Raghavendra for his patriotism, while others criticized him for being too ""over the top"".

Regardless of the reaction, Raghavendra said that he was happy with the attention that the car number plate had received. He said that he hoped that it would inspire other people to show their support for PM Modi.

Meanwhile, another Indian national residing in New Jersey, Jesal Nar, said, ""It's really an honour and pride to see the tricolour. I go across the United States for my work purpose carrying a tricolour.""

Prime Minister Modi is visiting the US from June 21-24 at the invitation of US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. They will host Modi at a state dinner on June 22. The visit also includes an address to the Joint Session of the Congress on June 22. He will address an invitation-only gathering of diaspora leaders from across the country at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington on June 23.

388,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/22/modi-us-biden-visit-indian-american-politics,"As Modi visits, Indian American lawmakers face balancing act",2023-06-22 00:00:00,"Ahead of Narendra Modi’s state visit to Washington this week, Pramila Jayapal – a progressive Democratic congresswoman – circulated a letter signed by dozens of congressional lawmakers calling for Joe Biden to acknowledge the erosion of human rights and democracy during the Indian prime minister’s nine years in power.

“A series of independent, credible reports reflect troubling signs in India toward the shrinking of political space, the rise of religious intolerance, the targeting of civil society organizations and journalists, and growing restrictions on press freedoms and internet access,” it warned.

The letter was also signed by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren; notable in their absence, however, were several other Indian American politicians and Democrats, including Ro Khanna, Shri Thanedar, Ami Bera and Raja Krishnamoorthi.

Modi’s state visit comes at a consequential time for the small but record number of Indian Americans in Congress.

Many of these same lawmakers have led some of the country’s most vocal and comprehensive responses to the threats against US democracy, from the bipartisan focus on China to voting rights legislation.

But speaking out on India’s crackdown on religious freedoms, press and speech comes with political risk: some lawmakers serve large diaspora constituencies and surveys suggest at least half of Indian Americans remain supportive of Modi. The voting bloc is also only growing in political influence and importance – now 4 million strong and on track to be the largest among Asian Americans.

Meanwhile, a growing number of Indian Americans are speaking out against Modi’s brand of Hindu nationalism – Hindutva – and its repercussions in India and abroad.

“It’s difficult terrain for Indian American politicians to have to navigate or lead a response to the Modi visit,” said Sara Sadhwani, a politics professor at Pomona College and author and researcher of the Indian American Elections Survey. “It’s one thing to support the relationship of the US and India. It’s another thing to support a leader.”

Khanna, a congressman from California, represents the largest Asian American district in the country. The Democratic-majority district is home to some of the most concentrated south Asian communities in the US, and Khanna was recently named co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans.

But when Khanna has broached the topic of Modi in recent years, he has quickly met backlash from Modi supporters and critics alike. In 2019, he tweeted a call for Hindu American politicians to “stand for pluralism, reject Hindutva, and speak for equal rights for Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists and Christians”. More than 200 Indian American organizations immediately lodged complaints, and called for him to resign from the Congressional Pakistan Caucus.

Last month, when Khanna joined the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, in inviting Modi to address Congress, advocacy organisations and activists such as the Indian American Muslim Council expressed their own disappointment.

“I support very strongly the US-India strategic relationship and I also believe it has to be grounded in a commitment to the rule of law, to pluralism, to human rights – we have to build and strengthen the relationship,” Khanna told the Guardian, adding that the “vast majority” of his constituents felt the same. His office did not immediately comment on Jayapal’s letter.

Krishnamoorthi, a congressman from Illinois also acknowledged the complicated issues of democracy in India, but pointed to the country’s role in the context of the US’s tensions with China.

“What’s very important is that right now democracy is under threat [in the US and India] and we have to do what it takes to buck up,” he said. “I’ve lived through January 6 – it represents how fragile our own democracy is. At the same time I’m aware of what’s happening in India and concerned.

“We have to make sure we leverage each other’s strengths and promote democracy everywhere. Because remember there is an alternative model out there that is being shopped by the Chinese Communist party.”

Such qualified acknowledgments of the threats facing democracy in India don’t go far enough for some.

“The White House and Congress are making a terrible mistake by celebrating Modi on this trip,” said Arjun Sethi, a Georgetown Law professor and human rights activist. “Human rights abuses continue to worsen under his administration and they should be asking him very difficult questions instead of honoring him.”

Sethi pointed to numerous internet blackouts that the Modi government has used to quell dissent and the extreme tactics to stifle the press, whether by blocking accounts on Twitter or deporting journalists. But he said the onus was not just on lawmakers, but on members of the community itself.

“There is a well-known phenomenon among south Asians in America who proclaim to be liberal and supporters of human rights – except when it comes to Modi, violence and hate against marginalized communities in India,” he said.

Sadanand Dhume, a senior fellow focused on south Asian politics at the American Enterprise Institute, said lawmakers like Khanna have to do a “balancing act” to serve both a progressive base and Modi supporters. But he also said the chasm between Indian Americans supporting Modi and those who were either critical or indifferent of him was only expected to grow with the younger population.

“Hindu nationalism as an ideology is innately unappealing, and there’s a large proportion of the Indian American community that is not Hindu,” he said. “The ideas espoused by the BJP [Modi’s party] are simply not compatible with liberal democracy as we understand it.”

The White House, in the meantime, has done its own balancing act. Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, said the administration will “make our views known” on India’s press and religious freedoms, according to Reuters. “We do so in a way where we don’t seek to lecture or assert that we don’t have challenges ourselves.

With all of the careful political calculus, Thursday’s events promise to be contentious. Some members of Congress – including Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib – will boycott Modi’s address to the chambers because of anti-Muslim sentiment. And thousands of Indian Americans, which will probably include influential political donors, invited to Modi’s address could encounter protesters outside the White House complex.

But for some Indian American lawmakers, the ability to simultaneously represent the US and strengthen a relationship with India is worth protecting.

“I just want to focus on the people of both countries,” said Thanedar, a congressman from Michigan. “I’d like to see a much stronger relationship with India than we’ve seen in the last several decades.”"

Modi, 72, was first elected prime minister in 2014 and then reelected in 2019. Since then, Modi has earned an international reputation as an unyielding Hindu nationalist and a strongman who leads with tight control.

We are political scientists who have written extensively on U.S. foreign policy and the relationship between the U.S. and India, as well as democracy.

Over the past few years, particularly since Modi’s 2019 reelection, some scholars and analysts have written about democracy declining in India. This is partly because of new regulations and government pressure to censor news media and free speech critical of Modi.

The U.S. does not routinely give state visit invitations to world leaders. Modi is also set to address Congress, another honor that is rarely granted to a visiting foreign dignitary.

But in our view, the U.S. is courting India because it needs the country to serve as a strategic bulwark against China’s expansionist policies in Asia.

Understanding Modi

Modi grew up in India’s western state of Gujarat, in fairly modest circumstances. He had a long career in local and state politics and developed a reputation as a tough-minded, but able, politician.

A longtime member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a militant Hindu political organization, Modi has been characterized by Indian political observers and foreign analysts alike for his strong Hindu nationalist views.

Hinduism is the most popular religion in India,, but people there also practice Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism.

Hindu nationalism has been on the rise in recent years, spawned by some people’s belief that India is and should be a predominantly Hindu nation, and that its policies should reflect that.

At times, this rise in Hindu nationalism has taken a violent turn.

When Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat in February 2002, Hindu zealots carried out a riot there that killed more than 1,000 people – most of whom were Muslim. Modi has denied any role in this event, but police have said that the violence happened with tacit approval of the state government, including Modi.

The U.S. subsequently denied Modi a visitors visa in 2005.

But Modi has been a widely popular prime minister, with a 78% approval rating as of February 2023.

US and India ties

Ties between the U.S. and India grew under Modi’s leadership, especially around issues of security and defense cooperation.

India, for example, has purchased a substantial amount of sophisticated weaponry from the U.S. over the last few years. It has also signed three important defense agreements with the U.S. during this same time frame.

Defense analysts say that these agreements will significantly improve military cooperation between the two countries.

India has also become, albeit somewhat fitfully, a more active participant in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, which is a loose, four-country initiative that also involves the U.S., Japan and Australia. The group routinely meets to discuss security and trade, and occasionally carries out military exercises together.

These countries also share concern about China’s growing power in Asia. While India and China have an established trading relationship, different security issues – especially related to the disputed Himalayan border between the countries – have dogged diplomatic relations between them for nearly a decade.

An important point of contention between the U.S. and India involves India’s tepid response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

India has been reluctant to publicly criticize Russia in part because of its acute dependence on Moscow for weapons technology.. Modi has been in regular touch with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but has not condemned the invasion, only going so far as to say that now is “not an era for war.”

Questions dogging the visit

The Biden administration’s decision to invite Modi for a state visit is clearly designed to send a message to New Delhi about the significance that it attaches to the emerging U.S.-India partnership and India’s potential role in containing China’s growing strategic reach across Asia.

Modi is running for reelection in 2024. So, especially if the visit yields any tangible benefits for India, the meeting could result in some electoral gains at home.

Biden and Modi will likely discuss how to continue growing the countries’ relationships and how to respond to China’s influence – as well as the ticklish question of India’s position on the Ukraine crisis.

The U.S. is aiming to sell India armed drones, and Biden is also likely to offer India GE jet engine manufacturing technology. This would give India’s defense capabilities a significant boost and would also lessen its dependence on Russian military technology.

Questions about a weakening democracy in India, though, as well as violence against minorities, may come to dog the relationship.

Hindu extremist groups have increasingly attacked and harassed minorities, most notably Muslims, over the last few years.

Modi’s administration has also received international attention for its curbs on the freedom of the press, attempts to muzzle nonprofit groups and efforts to undermine the political opposition.

Because questions of democracy and the Ukraine war are so fraught, we believe that these issues could stall more political agreements and closer ties between the U.S. and India. How Biden and Modi tackle these various subjects during the visit could help determine the course of U.S-.India relations."

PM Modi US Visit 2023 Dates: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the US next week. According to a community leader in charge of hosting the event, PM Modi will speak on the role of the diaspora in India's development during his address to Indian Americans.

Modi US Visit: Schedule, date, and other details

PM Modi will be visiting the US from June 21 to 24 at the invitation of US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, who will host him at a state dinner on June 22. The visit also includes an address to the Joint Session of the Congress on June 22, as per PTI report.

On June 23, PM Modi will address an invitation-only gathering of diaspora leaders from across the country at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington.

PM Modi US Visit: PM Modi’s Washington DC event sold-out Chicago-based Dr Bharat Barai, who was at the Ronald Reagan Building venue in Washington DC on Wednesday to look after the preparation for PM Modi’s event next week, said that it is a sold-out event. The registration for all 838 seats has been completed, he added.

Barai said, speaking to PTI, as far as the registrations are concerned, they are closed for the host committee as well as other people.

“We had an extraordinary response, all by word of mouth because we had only 838 seats. So there was no time and there was no capacity if we advertised outside,"" Barai added.

He further said that they used the database that they had from the previous public meetings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and even before they could contact the people, they contacted them and it's all filled up.

Modi’s address to the gathering of diaspora leaders from across the country at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington on June 23 will be about the role of the diaspora in the growth story of India.

“We want to see what we can do as a diaspora to help India and the people of India come up to the new place in the world,” Barai said as quoted by PTI.

Barai said that though the event will have very few cultural elements, the organisers want to make it primarily an engagement between the diaspora and the prime minister.

Barai further said that the diaspora is very much excited about having such a visionary and working person who has propelled India to the fifth largest economy in the world. “Not only that, he has elevated India's reputation,” he added.

Amitabh Mittal from Chicago, meanwhile, thanked US President Joe Biden for inviting Modi on an official state visit. “He is the man of the action. He has transformed India. India has been waiting for someone like him to come and take charge,” Mittal said as he hopes PM Modi would make an announcement on the Hindu Heritage Month in October.

“We have received his letter twice already in the last two years. But since he's here on the ground, I would love for him to mention that October is celebrated as the Hindu Heritage Month. Not only in America, but Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and six other countries have joined in, and we have 30 proclamations already,” Mittal said as quoted by PTI."

U.S. President Joe Biden rolled out the red carpet for Modi on Thursday, declaring after about 2-1/2 hours of talks that their countries' economic relationship was ""booming."" Trade has more than doubled over the past decade.

Biden and Modi gathered with CEOs including Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai and Microsoft's Satya Nadella.

Also present were Sam Altman of OpenAI, NASA astronaut Sunita Williams, and Indian tech leaders including Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group, and Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, the White House said.

""Our partnership between India and the United States will go a long way, in my view, to define what the 21st century looks like,"" Biden told the group, adding that technological cooperation would be a big part of that partnership.

Observing that there were a variety of tech companies represented at the meeting from startups to well established firms, Modi said: ""Both of them are working together to create a new world.""

Modi, who has appealed to global companies to ""Make in India,"" will also address business leaders at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts. The CEOs of top American companies, including FedEx, MasterCard and Adobe, are expected to be among the 1,200 participants.

Not 'about China'

The backdrop to Modi's visit is the Biden administration's attempts to draw India, the world's most populous country at 1.4 billion and its fifth-largest economy, closer amid its growing geopolitical rivalry with Beijing.

Modi did not address China directly during the visit, and Biden mentioned China only in response to a reporter's question, but a joint statement included a pointed reference to the East and South China seas, where China has territorial disputes with its neighbors.

Farwa Aamer, director for South Asia at the Asia Society Policy Institute, in an analysis note described that as ""a clear signal of unity and determination to preserve stability and peace in the region.""

Alongside agreements to sell weapons to India and share sensitive military technology, announcements this week included several investments from U.S.-firms aimed at spurring semiconductor manufacturing in India and lowering its dependence on China for electronics.

White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said the challenges presented by China to both Washington and New Delhi were on the agenda but insisted the visit ""wasn't about China.""

""This wasn't about leveraging India to be some sort of counterweight. India is a sovereign, independent state,"" Kirby said at a news briefing, adding that Washington welcomes India becoming ""an increasing exporter of security"" in the Indo-Pacific.

""There's a lot we can do in the security front together. And that's really what we're focused on,"" Kirby said.

Some political analysts question India's willingness to stand up to Beijing over Taiwan and other issues, however. Washington has also been frustrated by India's close ties with Russia while Moscow wages war in Ukraine.

Diaspora ties

Modi attended a lunch on Friday at the State Department with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Asian American to hold the No. 2 position in the White House, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

In a toast, Harris spoke of her Indian-born late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who came to the United States at age 19 and became a leading breast cancer researcher.

""I think about it in the context of the millions of Indian students who have come to the United States since, to collaborate with American researchers to solve the challenges of our time and to reach new frontiers,"" Harris said.

Modi praised Gopalan for keeping India ""close to her heart"" despite the distance to her new home, and he called Harris ""really inspiring.""

On Friday evening, Modi will address members of the Indian diaspora, many of whom have turned out at events during the visit to enthusiastically fete him, at times chanting ""Modi! Modi! Modi!"" despite protests from others.

Activists have called for the Biden administration to publicly call out what they describe as India's deteriorating human rights record under Modi, citing allegations of abuse of Indian dissidents and minorities, especially Muslims. Modi leads the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and has held power since 2014.

Biden said he had a ""straightforward"" discussion with Modi about issues including human rights, but U.S. officials emphasize that it is vital for Washington's national security and economic prosperity to engage with a rising India.

Asked during a rare press conference on Thursday what he would do to improve the rights of minorities including Muslims, Modi insisted ""there is no space for any discrimination"" in his government."

The significance of this visit is solidifying the alliance between the United States and India, as well as the advancing shared commitments to free, open, prosperous, and secure relations in the Pacific region, he said.

This state visit will provide an excellent opportunity to further strategic technological partnership between the United States and India, he said.

""I am sure the discussion could focus on key areas such as defense, clean energy, space, and educational exchanges, manufacturing in India, and fostering greater corporation in this critical sectors,"" he said, adding there's a potential for enhanced economic collaboration between United States and India.

""This visit holds immense potential for advancing the partnership between our two countries, particularly in the areas of manufacturing, semiconductor production, healthcare, education, and climate change. It presents an opportunity for both nations to further strengthen their economic ties and create new avenues for cooperation,"" Bhutoria said.

In terms of geopolitical, to counter the influence of China in the Asia-Pacific region, a strong political partnership between US and India is critical, he said.

Both of them need each other to build a strong partnership, whether the partnership in the form of QUAD between US, India, Japan, and Australia, and a stronger relationship between US and India is critical in addressing common challenges and ensuring stability in the region, he said.

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

The White House will roll out the red carpet this week for a crucial Asian ally. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet President Biden on Thursday, with a lavish state dinner also on the schedule. That same day, Modi will address a joint session of Congress. The Biden administration has made deepening ties with India a top foreign policy priority as it hopes to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Seema Sirohi is a columnist for The Economic Times, one of India's most influential newspapers, and author of the book ""Friends With Benefits: The India-U.S. Story."" She joins us now to discuss the trip. Welcome.

SEEMA SIROHI: Nice to be with you.

RASCOE: The White House is pulling out all the stops for Prime Minister Modi. Why is this relationship so important to the U.S.?

SIROHI: Well, the U.S. has identified China as a competitor, as a rival. So India has become very important for U.S.'s Indo-Pacific policy because the U.S. wants to retain its No. 1 position in the region. India, which has China on its border, is in a very sort of border standoff situation for the past two years. So the interests of both India and the United States have converged on countering China, to put it very simply. And then there are many, many other reasons why the U.S. thinks of India as a major partner. India needs the U.S. for its own development. The U.S. needs the talent from India. As you might know, there are almost 200,000 Indian students in the United States, and Indian Americans are increasingly very, very important, both politically as well as in the economic arena.

RASCOE: And so what will Prime Minister Modi want from President Biden during this visit? Like, what are his priorities?

SIROHI: So for India, technology transfer is a top priority. Becoming part of the supply chains is another very big priority. Both countries trust each other, and they are building what they call resilient supply chains so that the world will not be dependent on just one factory that is China. There is a deal that might be signed for one of the major U.S. companies to invest in trying to create a semiconductor ecosystem in India. Another big deal that is likely to be announced is for the U.S. General Electric to co-produce its military jet engines in India. And that's a huge step forward 'cause India has long wanted technology transfer. In the past things have stalled because the U.S. hasn't been so amenable to that.

RASCOE: And so, I mean, you've been covering this relationship for decades, so how has it changed over the years?

SIROHI: What I can tell you is when I first came to Washington, India was not an important partner for the United States. Everything was about China and Pakistan, both of which are rivals of India. Then President George W. Bush changed dramatically the U.S. policy towards India because Bush's idea was why aren't the two democracies better friends? So India and the U.S. signed a major nuclear deal under which India was recognized de facto as a nuclear weapons power. Now people are comparing that transformative moment to today.

RASCOE: Prime Minister Modi has been accused of eroding Indian democracy and suppressing criticism of his ruling party. Do you think any of that will be raised this week?

SIROHI: It won't be raised in public, I would say - not by the administration, not at the White House. But you might see some comments from congressmen and senators on Capitol Hill. But right now, realism in terms of geopolitics tops human rights concerns, to put it very bluntly. Countering China is very important for the United States at this moment, and getting as many allies and partners in line on the American side is the main goal.

RASCOE: That's Seema Sirohi, a newspaper columnist and author of ""Friends With Benefits: The India-U.S. Story."" Thank you so much for being with us.

SIROHI: Thank you.

The United States and India embarked upon the 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in 2018 and have regularly held it every year since then. The summit replaced the Strategic and Commercial Dialogue that had commenced under the Obama administration. Essentially, the 2+2 format was an outcome of an agreement between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi when both nations had agreed upon such a summit during PM Modi's visit to the United States in June 2017.

The meetings have included discussions on strategic and security issues between the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense on the US side, and their Indian counterparts – Minister of External Affairs and Minister of Defence. The dialogue enables the US and India to understand and appreciate each other’s strategic concerns taking cognisance of the political compulsions on both sides. The 2+2 summit has invariably deliberated and negotiated on areas of concern between the United States and India with an intent to improve and further strengthen the bilateral bonds.

The 2+2 meeting this year taking place in New Delhi comes in the backdrop of the much discussed Quad Summit expected to be held in India in January 2024, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin attending the 2+2 meetings with the Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. Given the massive bilateral synergies, along with a tumultuous geopolitical landscape – there is much to be discussed.

Geopolitical Puzzles

Even though some global conflicts go beyond the direct realm of the US-India relationship, they do form a backdrop that adversely impacts the geopolitical dynamics. Efforts to create an equitable international order that both the US and India believe in, thus will be crucial during the summit.

Discussions on the strife between Israel and Hamas and the resultant humanitarian crisis in Palestine are highly likely. The Russia-Ukraine war is far from over with its significant geopolitical ramifications as well as adverse impact on oil supply and food chains. There is bound to be reference to this long-drawn war as well.

Additionally, the India-Canada relationship may be raised during the summit as India would like to ascertain the US response to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations about India’s role in the killing of the Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The US is likely to stick to its line that India must cooperate with the Canadian investigations in consonance with standard global conventions.

China Question

The world has witnessed China’s use of military, economic and diplomatic coercion to expand its influence. China would invariably feature in discussions given its ongoing geopolitical posturing.

In recent years, China has increased its military manoeuvring in the resource-rich and biogeographic Indo-Pacific region including the Indian Ocean and the central and western Pacific Ocean, as well as the South China Sea.

No wonder, the US and India are also expected to discuss the Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, as well as the Pacific region. Both nations are likely to propel their collaboration to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region which is safe, prosperous and resilient.

Bilateral Cooperation

The focus in defense cooperation for US-India is currently largely on technology transfer and co-manufacturing, underlining the importance of innovation in furthering military capabilities. The agenda for the summit is likely to include the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) as well as the India-U.S. Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X).

Some areas of common interest in the space programme may also get discussed, as well as ongoing collaboration between NASA and ISRO on select missions. The need to step up climate action as a precursor to COP28 may also come up for discussion.

Such discussions often find boundaries defined by the scope and terms of reference getting blurred. The 2+2 discussions may also include the climate crisis, anti-terrorism measures, healthcare issues, visa irritants, higher education cooperation.

While the Indian general elections and the US federal elections, both scheduled in 2024, are essentially each country’s internal affairs, they may be the underlying drivers behind defining specific priorities for both the nations.

This summit would be preparatory ground for President Biden's likely visit to New Delhi for the Quad summit, and India’s Republic Day celebrations in January 2024 where he has been invited as Chief Guest. The 2+2 summit in New Delhi would hopefully help build a stronger and holistic relationship between the US and India in an ever-evolving and complex global environment.

Regardless, as far as global diplomacy is concerned, such a high-level and on-going engagement is invariably indicative of a robust partnership between nations.

India Is at the High Table, and the United States Knows It

Donald Camp

Adjunct Fellow, Chair in U.S.-India Policy Studies

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will head to New Delhi for the 2+2 summit on November 10. The summit will provide the two countries an opportunity to discuss bilateral cooperation, as well as the international foreign policy space.

With multiple significant events happening on the global scale—from Ukraine to Palestine—perhaps the most significant facet of the summit is that it is happening at all.

Naturally, the Middle East and Ukraine are currently drawing significantly more attention these days than the growing defense and diplomatic ties between Delhi and Washington. Each of these crises—much less two at the same time—has in the past caused one side (almost always the United States) to postpone travel and routine consultations and focus on the crisis du jour.

The difference this time is that Washington policymakers appear to mean it when they call their relationship with India one of the most consequential of the current century.

Washington is demonstrating this by seeing India as part of the solution rather than as a sideshow in world politics. The Biden administration is bothered by the fact that Delhi does not see the war in Ukraine though the same prism as Washington. But the Israel-Hamas conflict finds India and the United States closer and is a good harbinger for the future.

India has long wanted to be at the high table of global diplomacy. It may not be in the UN Security Council, but it is well on its way to being an essential voice in global politics. As the most populous country in the world, a leader of the Global South, and with a fast-growing modern economy, India has a place at the table.

Thus, it can be expected that this summit will be less of a teeing up of “deliverables” for the United States to bestow on India in the runup to another presidential visit early next year, and more of a serious global discussion among ministers who have gotten to know each other very well through frequent communication over the past three years.

They will assess bilateral issues, of course. However, a substantial part of the discussion will be how to deal with global crises such as the Middle East and Ukraine. Additionally, addressing climate change and responding to a rising and often combative China will be on the topline agenda too. India may not have the answers, but the perspective it brings to the table and its diplomatic, economic, and political reach around the world are crucial to dealing with global problems."
397,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/indias-modi-gets-glitzy-reception-with-state-visit-with-biden-but-human-rights-concerns-raised,"India’s Modi gets glitzy reception in state visit with Biden, but human rights concerns raised",2023-06-22 10:53:14-05:00,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are marking the state visit of the Indian leader on Thursday by launching new partnerships in defense, semiconductor manufacturing and more sectors as the leaders look to strengthen their countries’ crucial — albeit complicated — relationship.

Thousands gathered on the White House South Lawn ahead of the formal welcoming ceremony, listening to performances by violinist Vibha Janakiraman and the a cappella group Penn Masala as they waited for Modi’s arrival.

But as Biden fetes Modi, human rights advocates and some U.S. lawmakers are questioning the Democratic president’s decision to offer the high honor to a leader whose nine-year tenure over the world’s biggest democracy has been marked by a backslide in political, religious and press freedoms.

Biden administration officials say honoring Modi, the leader of the conservative Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is Diplomacy 101. The U.S.-India relationship will be vital in coming decades as both sides navigate an ascendant China and enormous challenges posed by climate change, artificial intelligence, supply chain resilience and other issues.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden will raise his concerns but will avoid lecturing the prime minister during their formal talks.

“The question of where politics and the question of democratic institutions go in India is going to be determined within India by Indians. It’s not going to be determined by the United States,” Sullivan said. “So what we can do is our part, and our part is to speak out on behalf of universal values.”

Among the major announcements to be made Thursday is an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones, according to senior Biden administration officials. The officials briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to preview the major agreements ahead of their formal announcement.

The Biden administration also is unveiling plans aimed at bolstering India’s semiconductor industry. U.S.-based Micron Technology has agreed to build a $2.75 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in India, with Micron spending $800 million and India funding the rest. U.S.-based Applied Materials is announcing it will launch a new semiconductor center for commercialization and innovation in India, and Lam Research, another semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will start a training program for 60,000 Indian engineers.

On the space front, India will sign on to the the Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space exploration cooperation among nations participating in NASA’s lunar exploration plans. NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station next year.

The State Department will also announce plans to open consulates in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad, while India will reopen its consulate in Seattle.

Despite the major deals, the visit will be shadowed by concerns laid out by rights activists and lawmakers that question Modi’s commitment to democratic principles.

Modi has faced criticism over legislation amending the country’s citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalization for some migrants but excludes Muslims, a rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities by Hindu nationalists, and the recent conviction of India’s top opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, for mocking Modi’s surname.

In 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi’s visa to the U.S., citing concerns that, as chief minister of Gujarat, he did not act to stop communal violence during 2002 anti-Muslim riots that left more than 1,000 people dead. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.

Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar on Minnesota have said they will boycott Modi’s address on Thursday before a joint meeting of Congress. And a group of more than 70 lawmakers wrote Biden this week calling on him to use his meeting with Modi to raise concerns about the erosion of religious, press and political freedoms.

“It is an important country to me, and we must call out some of the real issues that are threatening the viability of of democracy in all of our countries,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who was born in India and helped organize the lawmakers’ letter. “If India continues to backslide, I think it will affect our ability to have a really strong relationship with the country.”

Biden and Modi have also had differences over Russia’s war in Ukraine. India abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions condemning Russia and refused to join the global coalition against Russia. Since the start of the war, the Modi government has also dramatically increased its purchase of Russian oil.

White House officials note that there are signs of change in India’s relationship with Russia, which has long been New Delhi’s biggest defense supplier.

India is moving away from Russian military equipment, looking more to the U.S., Israel, the United Kingdom and other nations. Modi recently met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and has spoken out about his worries about the potential use of nuclear weapons by Russia.

State visits typically are reserved for America’s closest allies, but they also have been used in the past as a carrot to try to strengthen relationships with countries with which the United States has had complicated relationships.

President Barack Obama honored Chinese Presidents Hu Jintao in 2011 and Xi Jinping in 2015.

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter hosted Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran, and his wife for a state visit. That visit came about 15 months before the shah was overthrown in Iran’s Islamic Revolution.

Violent clashes between pro- and anti-shah demonstrators broke out just south of the White House, leading police to deploy tear gas as an official ceremony was underway on the South Lawn. The stinging tear gas wafted to the welcoming ceremony.

Carter later apologized to the shah for the “air pollution.”

Modi’s busy itinerary on Thursday includes an Oval Office meeting with Biden, his address to Congress and a lavish White House state dinner hosted by Biden and first lady Jill Biden.

Modi, who hasn’t taken part in a formal press conference in years, has agreed to participate in one with Biden, according to the White House. Typically, state visits include a news conference in which the leaders take questions from two members of the U.S. press and two from the visiting press corps.

Modi is to be honored at a State Department luncheon on Friday hosted by Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He also is scheduled to address members of the Indian diaspora before departing Washington.

“President Biden is invested in making sure we get this partnership between these two countries, between these two peoples, right,” Sullivan said, adding that this could “deliver benefits to both of our peoples and to the world as a whole in the decades to come.”

398,https://apnews.com/article/biden-modi-india-state-visit-white-house-c969d6e4e9770c105ca7affe7c190714,India’s Modi to visit White House in June as Biden seeks stronger ties amid competition with China,2023-05-10 19:40:36,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House next month, courting an Indo-Pacific leader with whom he has sought stronger ties as the United States looks to blunt China’s growing assertiveness in the region.

Modi’s visit June 22 “will affirm the deep and close partnership between the United States and India and the warm bonds of family and friendship that link Americans and Indians together,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday in announcing the Indian leader’s official state visit.

Biden and Modi will focus on their countries’ commitment to a free and secure Indo-Pacific region, as well as on their technology partnerships, including in defense, clean energy and space, she said. They will also discuss common challenges, including climate change, health security and developing the workforce.

India’s Ministry of External Affairs said the visit will “underscore the growing importance of the strategic partnership between India and the United States”

“This historic visit offers a valuable opportunity for India and the US to further deepen a comprehensive and forward-looking global strategic partnership,” the Indian government said.

U.S.-India relations under Biden have been warm, but also marked by complexity as Biden has sought stronger ties with the world’s largest democracy while at the same time looking to counter China’s growing economic and military assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region.

Since coming to office, Biden has sought to reinvigorate the Quad, an international partnership with the U.S., Australia, India and Japan. But unlike the other Quad countries and nearly every other major U.S. ally, India has not imposed sanctions on Russia and has offered only limited criticism of its invasion of Ukraine. Russia is India’s biggest supplier of military hardware.

The partnership first formed during the response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that killed some 230,000 people. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is set to host Biden, Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a Quad Leaders’ Summit in Sydney later this month.

As Biden worked to unite the world against Russia, India boosted its imports of Russian oil. That allowed India to increase its energy supplies at a discount as its economy struggled to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

When Modi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September, he offered measured public comments about Russia’s actions in Ukraine. “I know that today’s era is not of war,” Modi told Putin.

But Biden has put a premium stronger economic ties with India and other Indo-Pacific nations amid growing competition with China. That’s helped soften the differences between the U.S. and India over Russia.

“So even though, on Russia, Ukraine, and a whole range of other issues around the world, we do have differences in approaches and different views,” said Richard Rossow, senior adviser and chairperson of U.S.-India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington “On the threat that we both kind of agree is the major emerging threat ... for the next generations, there’s very little daylight in our perception there.”

Last year, Biden launched a trade deal with India and 11 other Indo-Pacific nations called the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. The White House said the agreement would help those economies work more closely on issues including supply chains, digital trade, clean energy, worker protections and anticorruption efforts.

The president is likely to face criticism from human rights advocates for inviting Modi on a state visit and for plans plans to celebrate him at a state dinner, which is a high diplomatic honor reserved for close U.S. allies.

Press freedom in India has declined in recent years and opponents of Modi’s governing Hindu nationalist party have accused it of stifling dissent and introducing divisive policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities.

Modi has also been accused of trying to silence critics of his administration’s handling of the pandemic.

India routinely denies criticism of its human rights record. It has also rejected criticism by foreign governments and rights groups that civil liberties have contracted in the country.

Asked about the optics of lavish treatment for Modi, Jean-Pierre said Biden always discusses human rights concerns with his counterparts. She said the U.S.-India relationship is critical.

“This is an important relationship as we speak about the Indo-Pacific, as we talk about how to move forward in that region,” Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday during a trip with Biden. “The president believes this is an important relationship that we need to continue and build on.”

Modi had a warm relationship with Biden’s immediate predecessor as president, Republican Donald Trump.

In 2020, weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic forced much of the world into lockdown, Trump made a two-day visit to India that included a raucous rally at a 110,000-seat cricket stadium. Trump had hosted Modi in the U.S. in 2019, a visit that included a side trip to Houston that drew about 50,000 people, many from the large Indian diaspora in the U.S.

Biden last hosted Modi at the White House in September 2021 for a meeting of leaders of the Quad. India also holds the rotating president of the Group of 20 nations and Biden is expected to attend that summit in New Delhi later this year.

Modi is the third foreign leader whom Biden has invited on an official state visit, which includes an expansive arrival ceremony with pomp and pageantry on the White House lawn and a ritzy state dinner with scores of guests from the worlds of politics, business and entertainment. French President Emmanuel Macron visited late last year, followed by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in April.

The last time India was so honored was nearly 15 years ago, under then-President Barack Obama in 2009.

It’s just a matter of few hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi will fly off to the United States and begin his first ever state visit, starting 22 June. This is the sixth time PM Modi will be visiting America, but it’s his first state visit and also the first since 2009 that an Indian leader has been accorded such an honour.

Ahead of his trip, which will conclude on 24 June, and he will jet off to Egypt, there’s excitement and happiness, with thousands of enthusiastic Indian-Americans gathering at iconic locations across 20 US cities and organising unity marches to send a message of welcome to the PM. Even several American leaders have expressed their happiness and enthusiasm over Modi’s visit to Washington during which he is also likely to sign two major defence deals.

But amid this hype and hoopla, authorities are also strengthening the security, as there’s intel emerging that there are attempts by Pakistan’s Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to disrupt the visit.

What exactly is their plan? How does the Pakistan agency propose to disturb Modi’s first ever state visit? We reveal what’s going on.

Pakistan’s plan to disrupt Modi visit

Reports citing intelligence sources say that the ISI has held several meetings with pro-Khalistan organisations working on US soil as well as several groups working against India. The ISI, according to these sources, have provided these Khalistani and anti-India groups with money in order to plan and organise rallies during Modi’s visit to Washington.

It is important to note here that the Khalistani movement is alive and kicking in the United States and one of their most recent activities was the defacing of the wall of the Indian consulate in San Francisco, during the hunt for Amritpal Singh.

In 2021, top American think tank, Hudson Institute, had published a report titled ‘Pakistan’s Destabilization Playbook: Khalistani Activism in the US’ stating how these groups were building a stronger base in America. “Unless the US government prioritises oversight of Khalistan-related militancy and terrorism, it is unlikely to identify groups that are currently engaged in violence in Punjab in India or are preparing to do so. One seldom finds what one is not looking for,” it had said in its report.

Reuters has reported that the Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) will hold protests against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. For the unaware, the IAMC, as per its website, is the “largest advocacy organisation of Indian Muslims in the US”.

According to a report published by The Sunday Guardian, the IAMC is a well-known arm of the Pakistan deep state. It has relentlessly targeted India on matters such as human rights, religious freedom.

Apart from this, intel sources also told news agencies that there are plans to wave anti-Modi posters along the routes that he would travel while in the United States. Moreover, buses have also been scheduled to transport those who have been assigned charge of the demonstration to its location.

The ISI has also reportedly hired people to make anti-Modi trends go viral on Twitter before his US visit. Hashtags like #ModiNotWelcome and #SaveIndiafromHinduSupremacy have been created to fuel anti-Modi and anti-India rhetoric ahead of his US visit.

#ModiNotWelcome Damn 😳, a 5 member’s so-called “big rally” in support of Modi.. https://t.co/msgmRwJJai — Extreme has no limit is Dis’Qualified (@NitroRCX1) June 19, 2023

In New York, there’s also a ‘Howdy Democracy’ event being organised on 21 June – the same day that PM Modi will land in New York and head the International Yoga Day celebrations at the UN headquarters. The event, according to one of the organisers is being held “to highlight growing injustice” in India.

It hasn’t been revealed if the ISI has any links to this event or any other protest, but it won’t come as a total surprise if the Pakistani agency has links to them.

How Pak views Indo-US ties

Modi’s US visit is not only being spoken of in India and in the US, but is also being closely watched by Pakistan. Islamabad, as experts believe, isn’t happy with the growing ties between the two countries even though their ministers state otherwise.

On Sunday, Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif was quoted as saying that Islamabad did “not have any problem” with the United States deepening its ties with India, provided it does not come at the cost of Pakistan.”

“I think we do not have any problem with the United States developing a partnership with India if it is not at the cost of Pakistan,” Khawaja Asif added. The minister said Pakistan wanted good relationships with its neighbours and regional partners. “We have common borders with China, we have common borders with Afghanistan, Iran, India. We would like to improve our relationships with them if the relationship is not good. We want to live in peace. If there is no peace there, we will never be able to restore our economy the way we want to restore it,” he said.

Modi’s high-profile US visit

Modi is scheduled to arrive in New York on 21 June where he will lead the International Yoga Day celebrations from the UN headquarters. From there, the PM will travel to Washington for a state visit – which will see him not only receiving a 21-gun salute but also a grand affair at the White House for which tickets have already been sold out.

Modi will also address the joint session of US Congress – to join the club of handful of world leaders who have addressed the US legislature twice.

On 23 June, Modi will also address an invitation-only gathering of diaspora leaders from across the country at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington DC. Modi's event with the Indian diaspora will focus on their role in “India’s growth story”.

Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Indian ambassador to the United States, said on Modi’s US trip, “There is much excitement in the air. You would have seen messages, statements of welcome from governors. Members of the Senate, House, state legislators, industry, academia, think tanks and of course the Indian-American community stretching from across the US from Hawaii to Alaska, all parts of the US. The visit will have a ceremonial as well as a substantive aspect which will complement each other.”

The bilateral relationship has soared to new heights in recent years, particularly on economic, technological and defense issues. Underpinning these developments is both sides’ desire to counter China’s effort to project power and influence across the Indo-Pacific region. While Washington and New Delhi have their disagreements on issues like Russia’s war on Ukraine and human rights, they see the relationship as too strategically vital to be jeopardized by these differences.

USIP’s Tamanna Salikuddin, Vikram Singh, Sameer Lalwani and Daniel Markey analyze the significance of this visit, the difficult issues that will be on the table, and how China will factor will into the leaders’ discussions.

What is the significance of the state visit for both the United States and for India?

Salikuddin: Modi’s visit will be filled with substantive and ceremonial events, including a South Lawn welcome, a state dinner and an address to a joint session of Congress. While Modi has visited the United States several times, this will be his first state visit, demonstrating the depth of the bilateral U.S.-India relationship, which Biden has described as the “defining relationship” of the 21st century. Per the White House’s official announcement, “the visit will strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space.”

While none of the official statements mention China, this visit is all about China. As U.S.-China competition is only becoming more intense and the Biden administration identifies China as its “pacing” challenge, India is one of the most important partners for the United States in its Indo-Pacific policy. While India actively counters China on its northern border, its deepening relationship with the United States make it part of the bulwark of nations committed to countering Beijing’s malign influence.

Beyond the convergence on China, India and the United States are seeking deeper ties on economic, defense and technological grounds. This visit is significant in cementing the partnership, and no detail is being left unchecked with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan visiting New Delhi in the last few weeks. This visit and the broader high-level U.S.-India engagements this year — including Biden’s planned trip to New Delhi in the fall — are a high-water mark in the bilateral relationship. Coming 18 years after the historic U.S.-India civil nuclear deal, these engagements highlight the remarkable progress that has been made in terms of expanding economic, social, technological and defense aspects of the U.S.-India relationship.

As Modi departed India, he reaffirmed the significance of the trip: “I am confident that my visit to the [U.S.] will reinforce our ties based on shared values of democracy, diversity, and freedom. Together we stand stronger in meeting the shared global challenges.”

What are the difficult topics that might be on the table, and how are Biden and Modi likely to navigate these?

Singh: Biden and Modi are determined to take U.S.-India relations to a new level with this visit, and part of having a mature strategic partnership is the ability to tackle difficult issues and areas of disagreement.

Issues that get a lot of media attention include policy differences on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and issues of human rights and democracy. More below-the-radar are key regional challenges like Afghanistan and Myanmar; enduring difficulties in a bilateral trade agenda; and finding a way to cooperate more on global governance, especially regulation of technology and the digital economy.

India will also seek progress in easing visas for Indian citizens, especially student visas and H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers, and U.S. commitments to greater technology sharing needed to implement the high-tech cooperation the leaders have rolled out.

A major change over the past decade is that the United States and India can now disagree on some issues and continue to work together on a large shared agenda. Given the strong personal bond Biden and Modi seem to have developed, expect them to be direct and forthright with one another in private and broadly supportive and celebratory in public.

On issues like Ukraine, intense private consultations will likely touch on assessments of the state of the conflict and the need to ensure Putin does not turn to nuclear weapons. Biden may seek Modi’s assessment of Putin and possible paths Russia might take to end the war. On Afghanistan, Modi and Biden may share assessments of Taliban, al-Qaida, ISIS and Pakistan-based militant threats since the U.S. withdrawal. India has kept a small diplomatic presence in Afghanistan and may encourage the United States to engage more actively to partner in preventing terrorism in and from the region.

Democracy and human rights, which get the most media attention, will not be avoided, but expect a similar pragmatic approach. U.S. leaders are concerned about democracy everywhere — including at home. Biden has taken an inclusive view that all democracies face challenges and that leaders of democracies should work together to improve durable democratic development. That will likely be the approach with India. U.S. leaders will welcome public comments or gestures from Modi in support of pluralistic democracy, but do not believe that lecturing India on these issues can be effective. A logical takeaway is that the United States will handle human rights concerns with India more like it does with a country like Poland.

First and foremost, Biden and Modi both pursue the interests of their own citizens, and they seem to understand each other on this basis. For Modi, this means development and meeting the basic needs of 1.4 billion people by transforming India into a modern, global technology powerhouse that competes with China. For Biden it means rebuilding the American middle class and maintaining America’s global leadership. Underneath the lofty rhetoric about two great democracies, these leaders see pragmatic benefits for their own people coming from deeper social, economic, political and security ties. They will manage the hard stuff to protect those gains.

How might the outcomes of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s recent trip to India shape conversations on defense and technology?

Lalwani: Austin’s trip to New Delhi two weeks ago helped finalize agreements and set the table for Modi’s historic state visit to Washington. The 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy called for more technology cooperation with allies and partners, which produced greater technology-sharing mechanisms with Australia (through the AUKUS deal with the United Kingdom) as well as with Japan. Now the United States appears poised to take some unprecedented steps toward the third partner in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, India.

U.S. technology cooperation with India is likely to include co-production and technology sharing of General Electric engines, which will be used in Indian military fighter jets to deter and defend against China. Additional Defense Department efforts involve a defense industrial cooperation roadmap to expedite co-production of military equipment; new programs to network both countries entrepreneurs, research labs, industry, and venture capital fueling defense innovations over the medium term; and enhanced scientific collaboration on emerging technologies in artificial intelligence, synthetic biology and robotics.

The strategic result will be twofold — enhanced Indian deterrence and greater trust in U.S.-India defense collaboration. First, in the near to medium term, India will be able to augment its military capabilities to defend against Chinese aggression, which ratcheted up with the Galwan crisis and clashes during the summer of 2020. The defense industrial roadmap involves four focus areas for fast-tracking technology cooperation: air combat and land mobility systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR); munitions; and the undersea domain awareness (UDA).

As India is able to quickly develop better ISR assets, it will be able to identify the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) maneuvers or gray zone incursions on their disputed continental border much earlier. Similarly, better UDA will enable India to better discern and track Chinese submarine activity in the Indian Ocean, and share that data with friends and partners. With both, detection will play a critical role in deterrence. Greater land mobility systems will help India to quickly surge forces and supplies to flashpoints along the disputed border with China, while longer range munitions can threaten to interdict PLA supply lines in the event of a conflict.

The second expected result of this technology sharing effort can be greater mutual trust in order to enhance collaboration in the Indo-Pacific. The trust generated from top-down and bottom-up technology cooperation may be less tangible yet is more significant. India has made no secret of its decades-long desire for a high-technology partnership, and the great lengths the U.S. government has gone to fulfill this deserve serves as a costly signal of its commitment and reliability. With this mutual trust, both partners will be better able to engage in more advanced joint assessments, contingency planning, and exercises as they prepare to backstop each other, interoperate together, and share the burdens of deterring aggression and securing the Indo-Pacific commons.

What are the most pressing issues the United States and India will be focused on when it comes to China?

Markey: The bedrock for cooperation between the United States and India lies in a shared interest in deterring Chinese territorial aggression and challenging the extension of China’s political influence and military presence in India’s backyard.

The most immediate concern is along the Line of Actual Control, the contested China-India land border, where China has made vast investments in military infrastructure that have already enabled it to push India from former patrolling points and could, in a worst-case scenario, even enable large-scale incursions into Indian territory. U.S. officials are eager to help India reinforce its own capacity to deter and defend against such attacks, as they pose a genuine near-term threat to Indian security and represent a dangerous precedent that could intimidate other less powerful states across the Indo-Pacific region. U.S. defense sales to India are intended to fill immediate capability gaps (for instance, to improve border surveillance with U.S.-made drones) as well as to co-manufacture future weapon systems (such as fighter jet engines).

Also of concern to both Washington and New Delhi is the rapid growth of China’s navy. Although China’s military is disproportionately focused on challenges along the nation’s eastern seaboard, especially Taiwan and the South and East China Seas, the rapid modernization and expansion of its fleet enables operations across the Indian Ocean as well. U.S. officials aim to explore cooperative ventures with India that will enable better monitoring of and response to Chinese maritime activities.

Finally, whereas in the past Indian officials jealously perceived U.S. involvement in South Asia as a threat to India’s regional hegemony, now New Delhi is increasingly eager to see Washington play an active economic and political role in neighboring states across the region, such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, as a means to counterbalance Chinese influence."

Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, And Indian Minister of Defense Rajnath Singh Remarks Before the U.S.",,"EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR: Good morning and welcome to the fifth India-U.S. 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue. May I begin by inviting my senior colleague, the Minister of Defense Shri Rajnath Singh Ji, to make the opening remarks.

DEFENSE MINISTER SINGH: Good morning, Excellencies. Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken, it is a great pleasure to receive you both in India. I fondly recall our last ministerial 2+2 meetings in Washington, D.C., in April 2022. I welcome both of you and your delegation of India.

The India-U.S. bilateral relationship has seen a growing convergence of strategic interests and an enhanced defense, security, and intelligence cooperation. Defense remains one of the most important pillars of our bilateral relationship. Your visit to India is at a time when India and U.S. are closer than ever before. In spite of various emerging geopolitical challenges, we need to keep our focus on the important and long-term issues. Our partnership is critical for ensuring a free, open, and a rules-bound Indo-Pacific region.

We look forward to closely working with the U.S. across the domains of defense for capability building and for an abiding partnership which can address emerging challenges. I look forward to engaging in enriching discussions today.

Now I invite my counterpart, Secretary Austin, to make his opening remarks. Thank you very much.

SECRETARY AUSTIN: Good morning. It’s great to be back in India. Secretary Blinken, Minister Singh, Minister Jaishankar, we’re meeting at a time of great momentum in the United States and India partnership. In the face of urgent global challenges, it’s more important than ever that the world’s two largest democracies exchange views, find common goals, and deliver for our people.

We’ve made impressive gains in building our major defense partnership over the past year, and that will help keep us – help us contribute even more together to the cause of peace and stability. We’re integrating our industrial bases, strengthening our interoperability, and sharing cutting-edge technology.

The scope of our cooperation is vast. As our ambassador is fond of saying, it stretches from seabed to space. And of course the strength of our partnership is rooted in the people-to-people ties that are at the heart of our longstanding friendship. Together our diplomats, entrepreneurs, and students are expanding our partnership in new domains, including clean energy, artificial intelligence, and semiconductors. Our increasingly strong ties give us all hope for the future of this partnership and for our common efforts toward a more secure world.

So I look forward to today’s discussions and to an ambitious agenda that will keep moving our partnership into the future. Thank you.

EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR: Thank you, Secretary Austin. Colleagues, this visit is part of an intense diplomatic engagement between our two countries, and its highlight this year was the prime minister’s historic state visit to the United States in June, which has truly opened a new chapter in our relationship. President Biden’s visit to Delhi in September contributed immensely as well to the positive trajectory of our ties. His support was key to ensuring productive outcomes at the G20 Summit.

The dialogue today will be an opportunity to advance the vision of our respective leaders, building a forward-looking partnership while we construct a shared global agenda. In the 2+2, we will undertake, as we have done before, a comprehensive overview of cross-cutting strategic, defense, and security ties, technology and supply chain collaborations, and people-to-people exchanges.

Our meeting takes place even as we make rapid strides in all aspects of our bilateral agenda. Our trade is today in excess of 200 billion U.S. dollars; FDI is rising in both directions; 270,000 Indian students study in the United States; and we have a diaspora of 4.4 million. We are exploring domains such as critical technologies, civil outer space collaboration, and critical minerals, even while consolidating established domains. Raksha Mantri Shri has highlighted new elements of our defense cooperation, including industry collaboration and innovations.

A key focus of our discussions today will be the Indo-Pacific region. As we all know, India and U.S. are key members of the Quad, which is scheduled to meet at the leaders level early next year in India. Similarly, we are also engaged in other plurilateral frameworks which reflect our strategic convergences, such as the IPEF, I2U2, and the recently launched IMEC.

In the context of the ongoing global developments, I look forward to exchanging views about developments in West Asia – Middle East – and Ukraine, amongst others.

Once again, I welcome you, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin, and laud both of you for your friendship and for your support for our ties.

May I now request Secretary Blinken to deliver his opening remarks.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Jai, thank you so much to you, to Minister Singh, to my friend Lloyd Austin. We’re both grateful for your hospitality, for your partnership, and for this opportunity to join you for what is now the fifth U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue.

When President Biden hosted Prime Minister Modi at the White House in June, both of our leaders set out a very ambitious agenda to build an even stronger and even more comprehensive strategic partnership that delivers for our people as well as for the region and, we believe, for the world.

And together, we have been taking very concrete steps to deliver on the vision that our two leaders put forward. We are promoting a free and open, prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific, including by strengthening our partnership through the Quad, with Japan and Australia.

One significant way we’re doing that is by enhancing maritime domain awareness: sharing commercial satellite data with countries in the region to boost their capacity, for example, to combat illegal fishing, piracy, drug trafficking. We’re also coordinating humanitarian relief and disaster response efforts in the Indo-Pacific.

We’re harnessing together the power of innovation to make our economies more resilient and to make our communities more secure, while expanding inclusive economic opportunity. That’s evident in the cooperation on semiconductors and advanced biotechnology; on our unprecedented investments in deploying clean energy at scale in our countries as well as across the region; and our joint research and exploration projects in space.

We’re bolstering our partnership in international peace and security, and specifically, working to promote the rules-based order and uphold the principles at the heart of the United Nations Charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence. Our defense cooperation – which we’re strengthening again today – is a key pillar of that work.

Finally, we’re deepening the remarkable ties between our people, which is really at the heart of everything – exploring new educational exchanges, even building on what you’ve already described; steps to facilitate travel between our countries; reducing visa wait times. If there is one thing we’ve learned over the recent decades, it’s that when Indians and Americans study together, work together, collaborate together, the possibilities for progress are infinite.

It’s that sense of possibility that animates our enduring focus on this partnership and on the region that we share. Indeed, this trip is part of an intensive period of American diplomacy in the Indo-Pacific.

We are living, as the Secretary of Defense said, in an incredibly complex and difficult moment – no shortage of shared challenges that require our attention, require our determination, require our collaboration. And it only underscores how vital the U.S.-India partnership is – and how important our efforts are to further strengthen it, including through the dialogue today.

So thank you to our hosts, thank you to our colleagues, thank you to our friends.

EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER JAISHANKAR: Thank you, Tony. May I now request our media colleagues to kindly move on so that we can then begin our closed-door session."

Hyderabad: Three-tier security would be deployed at Parade Ground where Prime Minister Narendra Modi would public meeting organised by the Madiga Reservation Porata Samithi (MRPS).

The MRPS has invited Modi on the expectation that he would give approval for the sub-categorisation of reservations for the Scheduled Caste communities, as he had assured that the BJP would appoint a Chief Minister from among the Backward communities if voted to power.

MRPS president Munnangi Nagaraju Madiga said that they had mobilised over 15 lakh members from nine states, including Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, for the meeting.

""We have been fighting for SC categorisation for decades. Modi will make an announcement in favour of the Madiga community,"" Nagaraju said.

PMO and Prime Minister’s security officials verified arrangements at the venue on Friday and interacted with Hyderabad police officials. North zone DCP Chandana Deepti said that the Prime Minister would proceed to the venue after landing at Begumpet airport, he woud arrive by an IAF flight.

Modi will also meet Telangana BJP leaders and interact with them about the election campaign situation."

405,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/india/markey-modi-biden-united-states,India as It Is,2023-06-16 00:00:00-04:00,"It has been a ritual for decades. Whenever American policymakers travel to India, they sing paeans to the beauty of Indian politics, to the country’s diversity, and to the shared values connecting—in the words of multiple U.S. presidents—“the world’s oldest democracy” and “the world’s largest democracy.” This rhetoric may be gauzy, and it is certainly grandiose. But to Washington, it is not empty. In the view of U.S. policymakers, common democratic principles will be the foundation of an enduring U.S.-Indian relationship, one with broad strategic significance. The world’s two biggest democracies, they say, can’t help but have similar worldviews and interests.

“Our common interest in democracy and righteousness will enable your countrymen and mine to make common cause against a common enemy,” U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt wrote to Mohandas Gandhi, then the de facto leader of India’s independence movement, during World War II. During the Cold War, successive presidential administrations tried to get New Delhi to stand against Moscow by arguing that, as a democracy, India was a natural enemy of the Soviet Union. When President George W. Bush struck a breakthrough civilian nuclear deal with India in 2005, he declared that India’s democratic system meant that the two states were “natural partners” united “by deeply held values.”

Yet again and again, India has disappointed American hopes. Gandhi, for example, frustrated Roosevelt by prioritizing India’s struggle for freedom against the British Empire over the war against imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. New Delhi not only refused to align with Washington during the Cold War; it forged warm ties with Moscow instead. Even after the Cold War ended and India began strengthening its relations with the United States, New Delhi maintained strong connections to the Kremlin. It has refused to work with the United States on Iran, and it has made nice with Myanmar’s military regime. Most recently, it has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

If making democratic values the cornerstone of the U.S.-Indian relationship has always been a dubious strategy, today it is clearly doomed—because the very notion of common values has itself come to look fanciful. Ever since Narendra Modi became the Indian prime minister nine years ago, India’s status as a democracy has become increasingly suspect. The “world’s largest democracy” has seen an upsurge in violence directed at its Muslim minority, often whipped up by prominent politicians. It is trying to strip citizenship from millions of Muslim residents. It is muzzling the press and silencing opposition figures. The Biden administration, having cast itself as a vocal champion of democratic ideals, therefore finds itself on shaky ground whenever it characterizes the United States’ partnership with India as one of shared values.

But it continues to do just that. In January, for example, the White House declared that the two states’ joint technology initiatives were “shaped by our shared democratic values and respect for universal human rights.” In June, Modi will visit Washington, D.C., for a formal state dinner meant to affirm “the warm bonds of family and friendship” that link the two countries. In February, however, the Indian government made it difficult for a leading Indian think tank to raise money, a major blow to intellectual freedom. In March, Modi’s party removed one of India’s most prominent opposition politicians from Parliament—explicitly because he insulted the prime minister.

Yet even as the two countries’ shared values have grown weaker, their shared material interests have only gotten stronger. India and the United States now have a clear, common geopolitical foe in China, and each understands that the other can help it win its competition against Beijing. For the United States, India is a massive, pivotal power in Asia that sits astride critical maritime routes and shares a long, contested land border with China. For India, the United States is an attractive source of advanced technology, education, and investment. New Delhi may still have close ties with Moscow, but the uncertain quality and reliability of Russian arms mean that India is more open than ever to buying weapons from the West instead.

To capitalize on these complementary material interests, however, the United States must dispense with the idea that shared values can provide the bedrock of a strong relationship, justifying its high tolerance for New Delhi’s behavior on the basis of a bet on long-term convergence. Rather than considering India an ally in the fight for global democracy, it must see that India is an ally of convenience. This shift will not be easy, given that Washington has spent decades looking at New Delhi through rose-colored glasses. But the pivot will encourage both sides to understand that their relationship is ultimately transactional—and allow them to get down to business.

BAD BETS

American leaders, especially liberal ones, have long believed that democratic institutions are a defining feature of India’s identity—and the reason why New Delhi deserves Washington’s support. In 1958, for example, then Senator John Kennedy introduced a bipartisan resolution to increase assistance to India, premised on the idea that it was vital for the United States to support a fledgling democracy against communist encroachment. India’s “democratic future is delicately and dangerously poised,” Kennedy declared in a landmark speech. “It would be catastrophic if its leadership were now humiliated in its quest for Western assistance when its cause is good.”

As the former diplomat Dennis Kux wrote in India and the United States: Estranged Democracies, “The effort succeeded.” During President Dwight Eisenhower’s second term, Kux notes, “US assistance grew substantially, surging from about $400 million in 1957, to a record $822 million in 1960.” Eisenhower himself seemed committed to India’s democratic future. As the president stated in remarks at the opening of the World Agriculture Fair in New Delhi in December 1959, “Whatever strengthens India, my people are convinced, strengthens us, a sister republic dedicated to peace.” Six months later, Eisenhower signed a breakthrough multiyear deal with India to deliver $1.28 billion in food aid under the United States’ Food for Peace program, because India’s domestic farmers were routinely unable to meet the country’s food needs.

But if Kennedy and Eisenhower hoped that praising India would turn New Delhi into an ally, they were sorely mistaken. In 1954, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had explicitly declared that his country would remain nonaligned in the Cold War, rankling Eisenhower. Kennedy, as president, hoped he could bring India closer by having Nehru visit Washington in 1961, but the trip changed nothing. The prime minister rebuffed all his efforts to bring India into the United States’ orbit.

As Kux recounts, Kennedy’s Cold War successors were similarly frustrated by New Delhi. President Lyndon Johnson found Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s 1966 criticism of U.S. involvement in Vietnam to be particularly galling; his ambassador to India later recalled that the president’s reaction ranged “from the violent to the obscene.” Gandhi’s subsequent decision, in 1971, to conclude a “Friendship Treaty” with Moscow was later described by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as a “bombshell” that threw “a lighted match into a powder keg,” inflaming relations between India and Pakistan. And in January 1980, when India’s permanent ambassador to the United Nations effectively endorsed the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan, President Jimmy Carter was livid. Carter’s ambassador in New Delhi told Gandhi “what a devastating statement it had been from the American point of view and what a terrible backlash it had caused in the United States.”

Nonetheless, U.S. policymakers often praised India in the following decades, and policymakers continued to argue that India’s democratic principles made it a good partner. In his address to India’s Parliament in 2000, President Bill Clinton asserted that the strength of India’s democracy was the first of several important lessons it had taught the world. The administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama routinely employed the “oldest and largest democracies” formulation to describe Washington and New Delhi and their longtime ties. In a 2010 speech to the Indian Parliament, Obama repeatedly stressed the unique bond shared by “two strong democracies.” He then endorsed India’s effort to obtain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, suggesting that cooperation between India and the United States on the council would strengthen “the foundations of democratic governance, not only at home but abroad.”

Obama’s Security Council reform has yet to materialize, but it is difficult to see how India’s performance at the UN would ever live up to U.S. expectations. In the UN General Assembly from 2014 to 2019, only 20 percent of India’s votes were coincident with those of the United States. Even when votes on Israeli and Palestinian issues (on which the two states are even further apart) are excluded, the figure rises to only 24 percent. By comparison, France voted with the United States 57 percent of the time overall and 67 percent of the time when Israeli and Palestinian issues were left out. This divergence shouldn’t be surprising; India has routinely walked away from the United States’ biggest international initiatives. It has never joined a Washington-led trade agreement, for example. And it has never given much more than lip service to Washington’s drives to expand democracy, whether in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, during the Bush administration’s efforts to promote the so-called freedom agenda, or during the Arab Spring of the Obama years.

Hindu nationalism at home leads India to promote illiberal aims abroad.

Despite these disappointments, the Biden administration has continued to push for closer ties with India, leaning hard into the two states’ supposedly common values as it makes its case. President Joe Biden invited Modi to Washington’s two democracy summits, and the prime minister delivered remarks at each. In a May 2022 meeting with Modi, Biden said that cooperation between India and the United States is built on their shared “commitment to representative democracy.” When Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited India in July 2021, he said that “the relationship between our two countries is so important and so strong because it is a relationship between our democracies.” And on a March 2023 trip to New Delhi, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo praised Modi as an “unbelievable visionary” and declared that the two states were united by democratic principles.

But yet again, New Delhi has frustrated the White House on policies related to liberal values. It has, for instance, maintained ties with and sold weapons to the military junta that ousted Myanmar’s democratic government in 2021. New Delhi plays an active role in multilateral groups critical of the United States and the West, such as the BRICS, which also includes Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa. And it has continued to stand by Moscow. Shortly before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, India went ahead with purchases of Russian S-400 air defense systems, despite the threat of U.S. sanctions. Since the invasion, India has abstained on every decisive UN vote. It has refused to entertain any economic restrictions against Russia. It even began purchasing more Russian energy after the invasion began.

India’s behavior regarding the war in Ukraine, in particular, has angered many of New Delhi’s biggest supporters in the U.S. Congress. “Frankly, many of my colleagues and I are puzzled by India’s equivocation in the face of the biggest threat to democracy since World War II,” said Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who chairs the Senate subcommittee responsible for South Asia. “At a time when democracies are closing ranks to condemn Russia’s invasion, it is troubling, to say the least, to see India, the world’s largest democracy, sitting on the sidelines.”

AUTOCRACY PROMOTION

New Delhi’s position on Ukraine certainly cuts against its espoused values. But it is far from India’s biggest democratic failure. Since winning two sweeping national victories, one in 2014 and another in 2019, Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party has made India’s own attachment to liberalism more and more dubious. The BJP has hollowed out institutions that can check the prime minister’s behavior, including by politicizing India’s civilian bureaucracy and turning its Parliament into a rubber stamp for the party’s priorities. Modi also tolerates no criticism in the media, academia, or civil society. The government, for example, imposed an outright ban on a 2023 BBC documentary that detailed Modi’s role in the state of Gujarat’s deadly 2002 communal riots. The organizations that compile the three biggest rankings of democracy across the world—the V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) Institute, Freedom House, and the Economist Intelligence Unit—have all downgraded India’s score since Modi took office.

New Delhi’s democratic failings extend beyond eliminating checks and balances. The BJP is deeply intertwined with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, an organization that aims to give India an exclusively Hindu identity (and to which Modi belongs). Created in 1925, the RSS was modeled on interwar European fascist groups and charged with promoting, in the words of one founder, “the military regeneration of the Hindus.” This goal was directly opposed by Mohandas Gandhi and Nehru, who championed freedom of religion, celebrated diversity, and defended minority rights. That is why a radicalized Hindu nationalist and RSS member assassinated Gandhi in 1948.

India’s autocratic turn creates many problems for the United States. One is that it simply makes New Delhi less trustworthy. Democratically accountable leaders need to justify and defend foreign policies to their own citizens, which makes their decisions more transparent and predictable. Authoritarian decisions, by contrast, are far harder to predict. In addition, the more ethnonationalist New Delhi becomes, the less secure India will be. India is home to roughly 200 million Muslims—almost the size of Pakistan’s entire population—and it has an extensive history of communal violence. By repressing its minorities, India risks its tenuous stability in the near term and mounting and debilitating violence in the long term. And an India consumed with internal security challenges will have fewer resources, less bandwidth for foreign policy, and less legitimacy to play a constructive role beyond its borders.

India’s Hindu nationalism at home also leads it to promote illiberal aims abroad. Hindu nationalists believe that one of their top foreign policy achievements has been mobilizing overseas RSS-affiliated groups in the Indian diaspora to lobby other capitals, including Washington, to support BJP initiatives. Hindu nationalists also believe that India should be a sprawling, civilizational power, and many of them say they want to create Akhand Bharat—a greater “Undivided India”—in which New Delhi would build a “cultural confederation” of territory stretching from Afghanistan to Myanmar and Sri Lanka to Tibet. In 2022, for example, the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat claimed that this could be a reality in as little as ten to 15 years. His statements raised questions about what a Hindu cultural confederation would actually mean, and they have prompted at least some regional consternation about whether India’s drive for leadership will be as peaceful as the country claims.

Despite the obvious evidence of the BJP’s illiberalism, top Biden administration officials have avoided publicly criticizing the Modi government. Instead, they have brushed aside concerns by declaring, as Blinken did in 2021, that every democracy is an imperfect “work in progress.” Presumably, that is because Biden believes that expressing any concerns about Indian policies would cause too much harm to the relationship.

This fear is not baseless. Like most countries, India does not like to be criticized, so an honest airing of grievances would not go down well. But the current, disingenuous approach has its own price. Soft-pedaling concerns about India’s authoritarian slide, for example, weakens Washington’s ability to champion democracy around the world. In fact, it might actively encourage democratic backsliding. India is no garden-variety struggling democracy: it is the world’s most populous country and a leader in the global South. When Modi uses his association with Washington to burnish his democratic credentials and even to strengthen his self-serving narrative that Hindu India is “the mother of democracy” (as he declared during Washington’s 2023 Summit for Democracy), it sets back liberalism everywhere.

Praising India’s democracy also makes it hard for Biden to build the domestic political alliances he needs to cooperate with New Delhi on security. Many powerful U.S. constituencies, including evangelical Christian groups, are deeply concerned about India’s poor treatment of minorities, its crackdown on religious freedoms, and its stifling of the press. The New York Times and The Washington Post, along with other top U.S. media outlets, run stories and columns on these issues so frequently that BJP leaders have gone out of their way to label the publications “anti-Indian.” And influential figures in Washington are expressing growing alarm about India’s illiberal policies. In March 2021, for example, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Menendez wrote a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, asking that he use his upcoming India trip to “make clear that in all areas, including security cooperation, the U.S.-India partnership must rest on adherence to democratic values.” If Biden continues to emphasize principles in his pitch for better relations, his calls could face mounting opposition.

ENEMY OF MY ENEMY

India’s turn away from democracy is deeply unfortunate. But New Delhi is still an invaluable partner for Washington. In addition to being the world’s most populous state, India boasts the world’s fifth-largest economy, the world’s second-largest military, and a significant cadre of highly educated scientists and engineers. It has a large arsenal of nuclear weapons. And like the United States, India is deeply concerned about China, which it sees as a dangerous power intent on challenging the regional and global order. In a way, now may be the best moment for the United States to cooperate with India. The question is how far Washington should go.

In many cases, the decision to help India is easy. When China began encroaching on Indian territory along the Chinese-Indian border, prompting deadly clashes between the two countries’ militaries in 2020, Washington rightfully provided New Delhi with urgently needed cold-weather gear and intelligence on Chinese positions. It also expedited already planned deliveries of surveillance drones. Since then, U.S. officials have correctly concluded that they can have far more candid discussions with India’s leaders than they have had in the past about defense cooperation, both on land and at sea. They hope that the threat from China, combined with Russia’s disastrous invasion of Ukraine, presents Washington with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to decisively (if not immediately) get New Delhi to shift its heavy reliance on Russian-made military gear to U.S. systems.

Greater U.S.-Indian alignment on China also means the two states could cooperate on certain kinds of technology. Washington, for example, could work with New Delhi to develop alternatives to Chinese-built information and telecommunications infrastructure as a means to compete in a global industry that Beijing has threatened to dominate. The United States could also speed up its efforts to diversify essential industrial inputs away from China and toward India. New Delhi, in turn, would benefit from new economic investments.

U.S. cooperation with India must be tightly targeted to countering China.

But Washington must be careful about the ways it deals with New Delhi. It must remain keenly aware that India’s desire to work with the United States is born of circumstance, not conviction, and could quickly disappear. New Delhi, after all, spent most of the post–Cold War years vacillating about what role it should play between Beijing and Washington, and it often signed on to the former’s initiatives. Even after the border clashes, China and India have roughly the same volume of trade as India and the United States have. New Delhi is still part of the Beijing-founded Shanghai Cooperation Organization. And many Indian policymakers and analysts would much prefer a multipolar world in which India is free to navigate flexible relationships with other great powers to a world led by the United States or defined by a new cold war between Beijing and Washington—a world in which New Delhi must take sides. One of New Delhi’s greatest fears is being indefinitely consigned to the geopolitical sidelines.

For U.S. officials, then, cooperation with India must be tightly targeted to countering immediate threats posed by China. It is fine, for example, for the United States to conduct joint military exercises with India near the Chinese border, as the two states did in November 2022. It is also fine for Washington to strike transactional deals that obviously advance U.S. interests, such as a deal that gives the United States access to Indian seaports in exchange for finite technology transfers or additional intelligence. But when U.S. policies do not clearly enhance U.S.-Indian cooperation with respect to China, they should not receive the benefit of the doubt. The United States should think twice, for example, before approving a proposal General Electric put forward earlier this year to co-produce and transfer U.S. technology to India for advanced fighter jet engines. Washington may benefit from a better Indian military in the short term, but the GE deal could strengthen India’s indigenous defense industry for decades, which might not serve U.S. interests in the long term.

U.S. officials must understand that, deep down, India is not an ally. Its relationship to the United States is fundamentally unlike that of, say, a NATO member. And India will never aspire to that sort of alliance. For this reason, U.S. officials should not frame their agreements with India as the building blocks of a deeper relationship. The country is not a candidate for initiatives such as the AUKUS deal among Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (which will help Australia develop nuclear submarine technologies) because such deals entail sharing important security vulnerabilities that only sturdy liberal democracies—ones with broadly shared values and aspirations—can safely exchange. India’s uncertain commitment to democratic principles is also why Washington will never be able to share intelligence with New Delhi in the way that it does with its so-called Five Eyes partners: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

In fact, Washington should qualify its support for greater Indian participation in the international organizations to which New Delhi already belongs. India’s voice is essential on the world stage, especially because of its vast and diverse society. But considering how often India and the United States diverge on important issues, it is not a bad thing that no one has taken up Obama’s proposal to offer India a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Washington should similarly temper its expectations for the Quad—the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, among Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. The White House clearly hopes that the Quad can be an Indo-Pacific league of liberal democracies. But given India’s identity, it simply cannot. What the Quad can do is better deter Chinese aggression in the region, and it should dedicate itself to that task.

TRUTH BE TOLD

As the Biden administration pivots away from seeking an imaginary relationship based on values to acknowledging a real one based on mutual interests, it must be forthright. The administration ought to explain to Indian and U.S. audiences alike that shared concerns about China and a wide array of other common interests create strong and constructive incentives for cooperation; there is much that the two sides can do together. But Washington needs to cease endorsing Modi’s BJP. It must stop altruistically subsidizing the rise of another illiberal Asian giant. And the Indian government should know that its domestic political decisions have the potential to complicate and endanger relations with Washington. Indian voters should know that, too.

The Biden administration should also write and publish more reports that accurately depict India’s record on human rights, freedoms, and democratic practices. Such analysis should then become required reading for U.S. leaders, including Pentagon policymakers and uniformed officers, who need to understand how undemocratic the world’s largest democracy is. These reports must be scrupulously accurate, because they will certainly draw fire from Indian diplomats. But Biden should not worry that U.S. criticism will derail cooperation. Unlike Chinese military activities, a critical report from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom does not materially threaten New Delhi. If India and the United States are going to be strong partners, both sides need to learn how to navigate serious disagreements without sweeping them under the rug, even if that means suffering some unpleasantness along the way. U.S. officials can unapologetically explain the American perspective without being undiplomatic, just as their Indian counterparts frequently do.

Many U.S. opponents of the Modi government would go even further, arguing that criticism of India’s democratic shortcomings should be bolstered by active U.S. government initiatives—such as giving material support to Indian rights groups. Some critics have even encouraged Washington to withhold U.S. security cooperation unless India rolls back recent autocratic measures. But New Delhi is likely to balk at conditional defense ties, and pro-democracy investments will not be effective. India is almost unimaginably enormous and complicated, making it nearly impervious to outside political influence. As a postcolonial state, it is quite practiced at resisting, ignoring, or mitigating external interference. Better, then, to leave the task of strengthening India’s democracy to the Indians themselves.

U.S. officials must understand that, deep down, India is not an ally.

For now, that means the United States will have to deal with an unsavory government in New Delhi. But for Washington, this is nothing new. The United States has spent years cooperating with regimes it dislikes in order to bolster its security. At one point, it even worked with the country New Delhi and Washington are now trying to outcompete. The Nixon administration’s 1972 opening to China was intended to exploit the differences between Beijing and Moscow to deliver a decisive advantage to the United States in the Cold War. It succeeded: President Richard Nixon’s gambit deepened splits in the global communist movement, helped tie down Soviet army divisions along the border with China, and provided Washington with additional leverage over Moscow.

What followed, however, is much more controversial. Nixon’s opening eventually led to a deluge of U.S. investment in China’s economy and cooperation across many sectors—including, at times, defense and security. The United States’ contributions helped China quickly become the world’s second-largest economy. Washington instead should have had a greater appreciation for the ways in which U.S. and Chinese interests would most likely diverge as China’s power grew. American policymakers could have then lowered their expectations, narrowed the scope of official cooperation, and even ruled out certain types of commerce. In hindsight, it is clear they could have partnered with Beijing to contain Moscow without contributing so much to the rise of a peer competitor.

India, of course, is not China, and it may never pose the same sort of challenge. And New Delhi’s authoritarian turn has not been total. Despite the government’s best efforts, India still has free (if not fair) elections and a vocal domestic opposition. Americans and Indians can, and should, hold out hope that India’s diverse society will remake India into a liberal democracy more fundamentally aligned with the ideals that Washington seeks to uphold.

That, however, is not where India is today. The country is instead led by an ethnonationalist who tolerates little dissent. It is in thrall to an illiberal and increasingly undemocratic party, and that party’s grip on politics is only becoming firmer. Unless that changes, the United States will not be able to treat India as it treats Japan, South Korea, and NATO allies in Europe. It must instead treat India as it treats Jordan, Vietnam, and any number of other illiberal partners. It must, in other words, cooperate with India on the reality of shared interests, not on the hope of shared values."

जब अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति की बात पर जमकर लगे ठहाके

ऐसा ही एक पल उस समय आया, जब डिनर के दौरान अमेरिकी परंपरा के अनुसार टोस्ट सेरेमनी हुई। आमतौर पर टोस्ट में शराब का सेवन किया जाता है, लेकिन प्रधानमंत्री मोदी चूंकि शराब का सेवन नहीं करते हैं, इसलिए बिना अल्कोहल वाली अदरक से बनी एक पेय को टोस्ट में इस्तेमाल किया गया।

इस दौरान राष्ट्रपति बाइडन ने कहा कि 'उनके दादा एंब्रोस फिनेगन कहा करते थे कि अगर आपको टोस्ट करना है और आप अपने गिलास में शराब नहीं चाहते हैं तो आपको बाएं हाथ में गिलास पकड़ना चाहिए। आप सभी को लग रहा होगा कि मैं मजाक कर रहा हूं लेकिन ऐसा नहीं है।' बाइडन के इतना कहते ही कार्यक्रम में मौजूद लोगों समेत पीएम मोदी जमकर हंसे और खूब ठहाके लगे। घटना का वीडियो भी सामने आया है।

प्रधानमंत्री मोदी ने कही ये बात

डिनर कार्यक्रम के दौरान प्रधानमंत्री मोदी ने कहा कि 'मैं अमेरिका के राष्ट्रपति जो बाइडन को इस शानदार डिनर के लिए धन्यवाद कहना चाहता हूं। साथ ही जिस शानदार तरीके से दौरे के इंतजाम किए गए, उसके लिए मैं प्रथम महिला जिल बाइडन को भी धन्यवाद कहना चाहता हूं। बीते कल शाम आपने अपने घर के दरवाजे मेरे लिए खोले।' प्रधानमंत्री ने कहा कि 'दोनों देशों के लोगों की मौजूदगी से यह शाम बेहद खास बन गई है, यही लोग हमारी सबसे अहम संपत्ति हैं।'

Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India will receive a lavish welcome on Thursday in Washington, where he will address a joint session of Congress and be feted by President Biden and the first lady in a state dinner at the White House — only the third state leader to be hosted by the current administration.

Swirling around the pageantry of a momentous visit for U.S.-India relations, seen as an affirmation of India’s rise as an economic and diplomatic power, will be weighty questions of geopolitical alignments with regard to China’s economic influence and Russia’s military aggression, as well as the erosion of India’s secular democracy under Mr. Modi. How much if any of that will be publicly addressed by the two leaders is unclear.

The visit is a significant diplomatic prize for Mr. Modi, who was once denied a visa to the United States for his role in religious riots in his home state, and as prime minister has increasingly consolidated power and edged his country closer to one-party rule."

He lauded the inaugural state visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the United States as a pivotal moment ushering in a “new chapter in India-US ties.” Attributing the positive trajectory in bilateral relations to President Biden’s consequential visit to Delhi in September, Jaishankar highlighted the vital role played by the US leader in ensuring fruitful outcomes at the G20 summit.

Undoubtedly, the Indo-Pacific region emerged as the epicenter of shared strategic and economic significance, constituting more than 65 percent of the global GDP. Within the context of the 2+2 dialogue, the Jaishankar outlined a comprehensive review spanning strategic, defence, and security ties, technology partnerships, supply chain collaborations, and the nurturing of people-to-people exchanges. Beyond the geopolitical arena, he underscored the robust economic ties, with trade volumes surpassing USD 200 billion and a substantial presence of 2,70,000 Indian students in the United States, complemented by a sizable diaspora of 4.4 million.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the sentiment, characterizing the India-US relationship as the “strongest bilateral partnership ever.” Delving into collaborative efforts, he highlighted the joint pursuit of innovation to fortify both economies and enhance community security. The cooperation spans semiconductors, advanced biotechnology, clean energy deployment, and joint research and exploration projects in space.



Blinken highlighted the US commitment to the Indo-Pacific, outlining initiatives to boost maritime domain awareness and share commercial satellite data with regional countries to combat phishing, piracy, and drug trafficking. The QUAD partnership with Japan and Australia was emphasized, emphasizing the joint endeavour to promote a free, open, prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific. Furthermore, the collaborative coordination on humanitarian relief and disaster response efforts in the region was highlighted.



The two sides delved into geopolitical developments across various regions, with a particular focus on the Indo-Pacific, Middle East, and Ukraine. And expressed shared concern over the war in Ukraine, underscoring its humanitarian toll and the broader impacts on the global economic system and food security. Affirming solidarity, both nations pledged continued humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and underscored the imperative of post-conflict reconstruction.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with their Indian counterparts in New Delhi as part of an Asian trip aimed at showing unity over Russia’s war in Ukraine and preventing differences on the Israel-Hamas war from deepening.

Blinken said the U.S. and India were continuing to “deepen our collaboration on everything from emerging technologies to defense to people-to-people ties” and align diplomacy for “an Indo-Pacific region that’s free, that’s open, that’s prosperous, that’s resilient.”

He said the two sides discussed the crisis in the Middle East and “we appreciate the fact that from day one India has strongly condemned the attacks of Oct. 7. And as our joint statement makes clear, India and the United States stand with Israel against terrorists.”

Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said the situation in the Middle East was a big concern. While India has condemned the Hamas attack on Israel, it balances its position by calling for talks on “a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine living within secure and recognized borders, side-by-side at peace with Israel.”

Blinken met with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and “reaffirmed their shared vision for close partnership in the Indo-Pacific,” said U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.

“They emphasized working together to address ongoing crises such as Russia’s war against Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East,” Miller said.

Vinay Mohan Kwatra, India’s top bureaucrat in the foreign ministry, said India’s tense ties with China also were discussed at the official-level talks, but declined to give details.

​India’s relationship with China has deteriorated since 2020, when Indian and Chinese troops clashed along their disputed border in the Himalayan Ladakh region, leaving 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead. A standoff involving thousands of soldiers in the eastern Ladakh region continues, despite several rounds of military and diplomatic talks.

Blinken said he also discussed with the Indian side a diplomatic dispute that erupted when Canada alleged that India was involved in the assassination of a Sikh separatist in Canada.

Blinken said that the U.S. wants the two sides to resolve their differences in a cooperative way and urged India to “work with Canada on its investigation.”

The dispute started when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were “credible allegations” of Indian involvement in the killing of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar in suburban Vancouver in western Canada. India rejected the accusation.

India and the U.S. have held so-called two-plus-two talks between India’s external affairs and defense ministers and the U.S. secretaries of state and defense since 2018 to discuss issues of concern and strengthen bilateral ties.

Austin and his Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh, discussed a roadmap for defense industrial cooperation that will fast-track technology cooperation and co-production of defense systems, India’s defense ministry said.

“We’re integrating our industrial bases, strengthening our inter-operability, and sharing cutting-edge technology,” Austin said in his opening remarks.

Washington expects India to be a leading security provider in the Indo-Pacific region.

During Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States in June, the two sides adopted a policy guide for defense industries to enable them to produce advanced defense systems together and collaborate on research and testing of prototypes.

The two sides reached an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.

A joint statement at the conclusion of Blinken and Austin’s visit to New Delhi on Friday said the two sides reaffirmed their roadmap for defense industrial cooperation to strengthen India’s capabilities, enhance its defense production, facilitate technology-sharing, and promote supply chain resilience.

Delhi: US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Friday met External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar for the 5th India-US 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue which was held today. The Indian side at the dialogue was led by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and S Jaishankar.

External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar said, ""...This visit (of Secretary Blinken) has a particular significance because we need to follow up on PM Modi's June visit and President Biden's September visit. This is a 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue, so we take a broader view of what we are doing. As QUAD members, we will discuss the Indo-Pacific and finally, we will look at the global regional issues and what is happening in West-Asia and Middle-East as it is a big concern right now. I look forward to discussing it and other issues with you.""

What Blinken said

Blinken said, ""...When President Biden hosted PM Modi at the White House in June, both of our leaders set out a very ambitious agenda to build an even stronger and even more comprehensive strategic partnership that delivers for our people as well as for the region and we believe, for the world and together we have been taking very concrete steps to deliver on the vision that our two leaders put forward.""

""We are promoting a free and open, prosperous, secure and resilient Indo-Pacific, including by strengthening our partnership through the QUAD with Japan and Australia. One significant way we're doing that is by enhancing maritime domain awareness, sharing commercial satellite data with countries in the region to boost their capacity, for example, to combat illegal phishing, piracy, and drug trafficking. We're also coordinating humanitarian relief and disaster response efforts in the Indo-Pacific...""

""We're harnessing together the power of innovation to make our economies more resilient and to make our communities more secure while expanding inclusive economic opportunity. That's evident in the cooperation on semiconductors and advanced biotechnology, on our unprecedented investments in deploying clean energy at scale in our countries as well as across the region, and our joint research and exploration projects in space...''

""Finally, we're deepening the remarkable ties between our people, which is really at the heart of everything. Exploring new educational exchanges, even building steps to facilitate travel between our countries, reducing VISA wait times...When Indians and Americans study together, work together, and collaborate together, the possibilities for progress are infinite...""

What Jaishankar said

""The highlight this year was the PM's state visit to the United States in June, it has opened a new chapter in our relationship. President Biden's visit to Delhi in September contributed immensely to the positive trajectory of our ties. His support was key to ensuring productive outcomes at the G20 summit.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with their Indian counterparts in New Delhi as part of an Asian trip aimed at showing unity over Russia’s war in Ukraine and preventing differences on the Israel-Hamas war from deepening.

Blinken said the U.S. and India were continuing to “deepen our collaboration on everything from emerging technologies to defense to people-to-people ties” and align diplomacy for “an Indo-Pacific region that’s free, that’s open, that’s prosperous, that’s resilient.”

He said the two sides discussed the crisis in the Middle East and “we appreciate the fact that from day one India has strongly condemned the attacks of Oct. 7. And as our joint statement makes clear, India and the United States stand with Israel against terrorists.”

Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said the situation in the Middle East was a big concern. While India has condemned the Hamas attack on Israel, it balances its position by calling for talks on “a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine living within secure and recognized borders, side-by-side at peace with Israel.”

Blinken met with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and “reaffirmed their shared vision for close partnership in the Indo-Pacific,” said U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.

“They emphasized working together to address ongoing crises such as Russia’s war against Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East,” Miller said.

Vinay Mohan Kwatra, India’s top bureaucrat in the foreign ministry, said India’s tense ties with China also were discussed at the official-level talks, but declined to give details.

​India’s relationship with China has deteriorated since 2020, when Indian and Chinese troops clashed along their disputed border in the Himalayan Ladakh region, leaving 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead. A standoff involving thousands of soldiers in the eastern Ladakh region continues, despite several rounds of military and diplomatic talks.

Blinken said he also discussed with the Indian side a diplomatic dispute that erupted when Canada alleged that India was involved in the assassination of a Sikh separatist in Canada.

Blinken said that the U.S. wants the two sides to resolve their differences in a cooperative way and urged India to “work with Canada on its investigation.”

The dispute started when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were “credible allegations” of Indian involvement in the killing of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar in suburban Vancouver in western Canada. India rejected the accusation.

India and the U.S. have held so-called two-plus-two talks between India’s external affairs and defense ministers and the U.S. secretaries of state and defense since 2018 to discuss issues of concern and strengthen bilateral ties.

Austin and his Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh, discussed a roadmap for defense industrial cooperation that will fast-track technology cooperation and co-production of defense systems, India’s defense ministry said.

“We’re integrating our industrial bases, strengthening our inter-operability, and sharing cutting-edge technology,” Austin said in his opening remarks.

Washington expects India to be a leading security provider in the Indo-Pacific region.

During Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States in June, the two sides adopted a policy guide for defense industries to enable them to produce advanced defense systems together and collaborate on research and testing of prototypes.

The two sides reached an agreement that will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.

A joint statement at the conclusion of Blinken and Austin’s visit to New Delhi on Friday said the two sides reaffirmed their roadmap for defense industrial cooperation to strengthen India’s capabilities, enhance its defense production, facilitate technology-sharing, and promote supply chain resilience.

425,https://www.cfr.org/blog/what-did-prime-minister-modis-state-visit-achieve,What Did Prime Minister Modi’s State Visit Achieve?,,"Last week Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi completed a four-day state visit to the United States. Modi was not only feted with a welcome ceremony and state dinner, but was also invited to address Congress for the second time during his prime ministership. These high-profile events were intended to reflect the two countries’ shared commitment to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and signify that the United States sees India as a critical partner. Judging by the attention paid to Modi’s arrival and the deals announced, both countries came away with winning outcomes, singly and jointly.

For India, the honors bestowed on Modi—a man who just a few years ago was denied entry to the United States for his role in the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat—showed to the world that far from being a pariah, he is now the powerful and accepted leader of a valued partner country. The United States also offered concrete wins. The Biden administration promised to help India increase production of electric vehicles and meet its goal of installing 500 gigawatts of wind, solar, and other renewable energy this decade. U.S. memory chip firm Micron Technology will invest up to $825 million in a new chip assembly and test plant in Gujarat, which will be its first factory in India. On immigration, which has been a thorny issue, the United States agreed to allow a small number of Indians on H-1B visas to renew them in the United States without traveling abroad.

The United States too made symbolic and material gains. In terms of symbolic wins, the United States was able to showcase its close partnership with India—a country that also shares its deep anxiety about the specter of a rising China—and highlight the exchange of effusive warm statements between President Biden and Prime Minister Modi a mere two days after the former labelled President of China Xi Jinping a “dictator.” There were also material wins. Indian solar panel maker Vikram Solar Limited will invest up to $1.5 billion in the U.S. solar energy supply chain. India has also agreed to join the U.S.-led Artemis Accords on space exploration and will work with NASA on a joint mission to the International Space Station in 2024. In a huge political win for the Biden administration, India will remove retaliatory tariffs imposed on U.S. products such as chickpeas and apples without the expectation that the United States will remove its own tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that had initially led to these retaliatory tariffs.

Perhaps most importantly, both countries scored wins in their defense and strategic partnership. U.S. company General Electric has signed a memorandum of understanding with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to produce fighter jet engines for the Indian Air Force. While the deal is subject to congressional approval, this is a huge step both for India, which can domestically manufacture fighter jets but not the engines to power them, and for the United States, which is very choosy about the sharing of military technology. Moreover, India’s defense ministry has approved the purchase of armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones (a type of Predator drone) made by General Atomics, which will enhance the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities of India’s armed forces across domains. Currently, only some U.S. allies own Predator drones. The two countries also established a Joint Indo-U.S. Quantum Coordination Mechanism to facilitate joint research between public and private sectors and launched the INDUS-X partnership to expand their strategic technology and defense industrial cooperation. India also agreed to join the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), a U.S.-led partnership with twelve other countries plus the European Union, to create critical energy minerals supply chains.

Finally, and significantly, Prime Minister Modi was also persuaded to take two questions in a joint press conference with President Biden. Although the two leaders sidestepped public critique and offered awkward answers to a U.S. reporter’s question about democracy and human rights (the less-loaded second question from an Indian reporter was about climate change), the fact that Modi, who has not held a press conference in nearly a decade, agreed to respond to reporters at all was a further indication of how important the bilateral relationship has become for both nations."

But times, titles and political agendas change.

President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden welcomed Modi, the prime minister of India, to the White House on Thursday for a state visit filled with the kind of pomp and pageantry afforded only to the nation’s closest friends.

Standing next to Modi on the White House South Lawn, Biden said he has long believed that the relationship between the United States and India will be “one of the defining relationships of the 21st century.”

Modi was denied a visa to enter the U.S. in 2005, when he was the chief minister of the Indian state of Gujarat, over accusations that he had failed to stop deadly riots against minority Muslims. But now that he’s the leader of the world’s largest democracy, the Biden administration has been embracing him more closely as it seeks to counter China’s global influence.

Given Modi’s history with the U.S., there were bound to be some unusual, and even awkward, moments during his state visit:

Pomp and pageantry:Here's why Democrats and Republicans welcome a visit from right-wing Indian PM Narendra Modi

Red carpets and yellow yoga mats

Not many state visits start with yoga.

But Modi not only walked the red carpet, he stretched out on a yellow yoga mat.

Modi, a yoga enthusiast, and roughly 1,000 other practitioners of the Hindu spiritual and aesthetic discipline demonstrated their technique on Wednesday, Day One of Modi’s four-day visit to the United States.

The 72-year-old grey-bearded prime minister took his place on a mat on the grassy North Lawn area outside the United Nations headquarters in New York. For the next half hour, he practiced breathing exercises, meditation, backbends and other poses.

""Namaste,"" he told the crowd before the exercises began.

The event was held in recognition of the International Day of Yoga, which Modi persuaded the U.N. to observe annually not long after he became India’s leader in 2014. This year’s event set a Guinness World Record for most nationalities – 135 – at a yoga session.

Modi’s message to his fellow yoga enthusiasts: ""Let's use the power of yoga, not only to be healthy, happy, but to be kind to ourselves and each other.”

The first lady and Modi take a field trip

The first couple of times the Bidens hosted a foreign dignitary for a state visit, Jill Biden arranged an outing with the leader’s spouse.

She took Brigitte Macron, wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, to the interactive Plant Word museum just a few blocks from the White House. Kim Keon Hee, wife of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, got a private tour of the National Gallery of Art.

But Modi’s spouse didn’t accompany him on the trip to Washington. What’s more, Joe Biden wasn’t in town for Modi’s arrival on Wednesday. He was traveling back to Washington from California, where he had been raising money for his reelection campaign.

So the first lady and the prime minister took a quick field trip to National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside Washington, to highlight workforce training programs.

Modi, who arrived late, missed a demonstration of a robot creating abstract art on paper and another showing how an underwater robot can be used to aid fishing. But in brief remarks, he said his government has established labs in schools to encourage young entrepreneurs.

His goal, he said, is to make this decade a “tech decade.”

A plant-based feast

The night before the official state dinner, the Bidens hosted Modi for a private dinner at the White House, where they dined on a few of the president’s favorite foods, including pasta and ice cream.

The menu for the official state dinner on Thursday catered to Modi’s palate.

Modi is a vegetarian, so the 400 invited guests were served an entirely plant-based meal: A salad of marinated millet. Corn and compressed watermelon. Stuffed portobello mushrooms and saffron risotto. Strawberry shortcake infused with rose and cardamom.

The first lady enlisted the help of chef Nina Curtis, who specializes in plant-based cooking, to work with White House chefs to come up with the menu.

Guests were given the option of adding fish to the main course.

Modi (finally) meets the press

It’s not unusual for Biden to hold a joint news conference with foreign leaders when they visit the White House.

But when Modi took the dais in the White House East Room on Thursday for a Q&A with Biden, it was a remarkable turn of events.

Modi, who tries to avoid unscripted moments and has presided over a steady decline in press freedom in his country, has never held a solo news conference and often avoids questions by deferring to others on stage with him.

Biden and Modi each answered two questions – one from an Indian journalist who asked Modi about climate change, the other from a Wall Street Journal reporter who pressed him on human rights concerns. It was the first time Modi had fielded a question at a news conference since he came to power in 2014.

The news conference was a scaled-down affair compared with those usually held as part of a state visit. Even so, Modi’s advisers were far from thrilled with the idea. Administration officials advised his team that taking questions from the media was standard protocol for White House state visits.

Modi’s people finally relented and agreed to the news conference – but not until the day it was to be held.

'No space for discrimination':India's leader claims government doesn't have a human rights problem

'No space for discrimination' in India

Modi’s state visit infuriated human rights advocates who blame him for widespread attacks against India’s Muslims and other minorities.

Biden’s administration has accused India’s government of participating in unlawful and arbitrary killings, restricting freedom of speech and allowing violence against religious, racial and ethnic minorities. A group of more than 70 lawmakers asked Biden in a letter Tuesday to raise the human rights concerns during Modi’s visit.

But during his joint news conference with Biden, Modi insisted there was no discrimination in India and argued that democracy is in India’s DNA.

“Democracy is our spirit, democracy runs in our veins – we live democracy,” he said, speaking through an interpreter.

“There's absolutely no space for discrimination,"" he insisted, which must have been news to his detractors.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet President Joe Biden on Thursday during his first state visit to the U.S. High on the agenda will be deepening of defense ties, partnerships in technology and India's role in the Indo-Pacific. Ties between India and the U.S. are at a turning point and the relationship between the two nations have improved in the last decade, said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at Observer Research Foundation, a Delhi-based think tank. ""This is a very important visit, it is as much about India reaching out to the U.S., as it is about the U.S. reaching out to India,"" Pant said. Biden has only hosted two state visits during his presidency, the first with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in December 2022, and the second with South Korea's president Yoon Suk Yeol in April. ""This visit symbolizes the unwavering commitment to deepening ties and signifies the immense potential for both countries to collaborate amidst global challenges,"" Farwa Aamer the director of South Asia initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said. ""For many in India and the U.S., the visit is a testament to the promise and high expectations for the future of U.S.-India collaboration — one of shared prosperity,"" Aamer said. The U.S. is looking at India as a partner it can rely on, but its partnership will be very different since India is not an ally, Pant told CNBC. ""The U.S. is not used to having partners that are not allies, but is willing to look at its partnership with India differently — one that is relatively independent minded but will help American priorities as well,"" he said in a phone interview.

Strengthening defense ties

India and Russia have long shared a steadfast relationship, with India relying heavily on the Kremlin for oil and military weapons. The South Asian nation is the world's largest buyer of Russian arms, accounting for approximately 20% of Russia's current order, Reuters reported. ""India has been too dependent on one country and that is not good, and although dependence has dropped from 80% in the 1990s to about 65% now, dependence is still huge,"" Pant pointed out. However, because of the war in Ukraine, Russia has not been able to send critical defense weapons it had promised India, pushing the Indian military to look to others — such as the U.S. — for supplies.

Still, analysts are optimistic that the meeting between Biden and Modi could lead to more weapons agreements. India has long been interested in buying SeaGuardian drones from the U.S., but the hoped-for deal that could be worth between $2 billion to $3 billion has been long hampered by ""bureaucratic stumbling blocks,"" Reuters reported. The deal could still be brought back to the table. ""India's Ministry of Defense has reportedly approved the purchase so it seems likely. The U.S. would like this to go through,"" Manjari Miller, senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations told CNBC. ""It would be important for the partnership — only a few military allies and NATO countries have this drone, and the U.S. is particular about whom it sells U.S. weapons and technology to."" She highlighted that now is an important time for the deal to come through as it will draw ""India closer into the U.S. defense orbit, and is a step away from India's dependence on Russian arms and equipment."" India is undermining its strategic options by thinking it can continue to rely on Russia, Lisa Curtis, senior fellow and director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. ""It wants to try to keep a wedge between Russia and China because it doesn't want to contemplate the idea of Russia and China both arrayed against it. Then you throw Pakistan in there and things look really dire from the Indian perspective,"" Curtis told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The drones will also enhance the Indian armed forces ""intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance capabilities"" that will aid the country in securing their borders with China and Pakistan, Karthik Nachiappan, research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore said. Tensions between India and China over the disputed border in the Himalayan region has been ongoing since the 1950s with no end in sight. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in June 2020 in hand-to-hand combat with Chinese troops, followed by another clash in December 2022. But India wants to ""go beyond a buyer-seller relationship,"" with the U.S., Pant said adding that India is working toward a ""co-production and co-development relationship"" with the U.S. so it can build its own domestic manufacturing defense base. Private sectors in the U.S. could also start making more significant investments in India, with the two countries set to work together on producing fighter jet engines, said Pant. ""There's a change in the way the U.S. looks at India, and defense will be a beneficiary of that. India will definitely be looking to reduce its dependence on Russia, and that will be quite an extreme move,"" he added. Without mentioning China, the White House said in May the visit will ""strengthen our two countries' shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space."" ""Both the United States and India share the objective of not having an Asia that is dominated by China, or an Indo-Pacific region that is subject to Chinese coercion and assertiveness,"" said Ashley Tellis, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in a Q&A report.

Energy: Reliance on Russian oil

Although India's purchase of Russian weapons could fall, the same can't be said for oil. When Western nations imposed sanctions on Russian oil as a result of the unprovoked war in Ukraine, India doubled down on its purchases. Russian oil currently accounts for almost 20% of India's annual crude imports, a significant increase from just 2% in 2021, Reuters reported. Oil prices were extremely volatile at the start of the Ukraine war in February last year, spiking to $100 for the first time since 2014 . But India has continued to buy cheap Russian oil since and continues trading with the country despite global sanctions on the Kremlin.

""India has become very close to the West in the last five to 10 years, but it understands that it cannot simply detach from Russia,"" Amit Ranjan, research fellow at the NUS Institute of South Asian Studies said. ""Russia is an old friend of India, and India understands the importance of the relationship … Oil is an important piece of that relationship,"" Ranjan said.

Technology: Diversifying from China

Partnerships in technology will be also be top on the agenda for Modi. ""I think the technology issues have become so critically important, as we see China making advancements and hear about China's advancements with AI,"" according to Curtis. ""In seeing how much China is advancing, the U.S. now understands the importance of really cooperating closely with India and trying to take advantage of the strengths on both sides,"" she said. ""There are so many ways that the two sides can benefit from this increased technology cooperation—not to mention the progress that has been made on semiconductors. This has been a real area of focus for India and the United States, and I see that only growing as we move into the future,"" Curtis added. There will also be a flurry of business meetings with tech leaders. Tesla chief Elon Musk met Modi in New York to discuss the EV company's ambitions in India and the possibility of setting up a manufacturing facilities in the country. Modi is also expected to meet other CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft's Satya Nadella and FedEx's Raj Subramaniam at the White House state dinner on Thursday, sources told CNBC. The growing partnership between India and the U.S. also gives room for the two nations to adopt a ""China plus one"" strategy and push more technology companies to set up operations in India, analysts told CNBC. The U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology was announced in May last year. The iCET initiative aims to ""elevate and expand"" the two countries' technology partnership and defense industrial cooperation, the White House said in January. Pant said it points to the two countries' willingness to work together — both in terms of research and development, and what both governments can do together. In the last six months, more U.S. technology companies have set their eyes on India."
