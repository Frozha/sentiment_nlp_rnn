The question that you must be asking is how come we are not even manufacturing and assembling. Design and fabrication is further on the curve. Then you know we need FDI. The dollars I mean. Surely you should know that! Come on! We went bankrupt once remember.

"SHOCKING!
Modi Govt used â‚¹1751 crores of public money to enrich an American company for Modi's PR:
During his US visit, Modi signed a deal with the firm Micron for establishing a facility in Gujarat
The deal is worth $2.7 bn i.e. â‚¹2274 crores
But here's the catch  The Micron deal is merely for assembling & testing semiconductor chips
 Assembling requires ZERO technological knowledge or transfer. It contributes NOTHING to India's semiconductor vision
 Micron benefits from cheap Indian labor & reduces its China exposure
But Modi Govt has shockingly subsidized & enriched Micron from public money:
 Of the â‚¹2274 crore deal, govt will contribute 70% i.e. â‚¹1571 crores
 Micron will contribute 30% i.e. ONLY â‚¹682 crores
And yet, Micron will OWN 100% of the plant with ZERO govt stake.Therefore,
 Micron gets to reduce its chip assembly costs & its business risk from China. This allows Micron to make extra millions in profit
 India gets to ONLY assemble the chips i.e. no technology transfer & no specialized knowledge
Who benefits: ONLY Micron. Despite investing 70% i.e. â‚¹1571 crores of public money, India will get ZERO stake in the Micron plant
 Micron gets 100% of an Indian plant worth â‚¹2274 crore ONLY by paying â‚¹682 crore
Why is the Indian exchequer losing â‚¹1571 crores to favor a private US company?Contrary to claims by Min @AshwiniVaishnaw, this plant does NOT benefit India's knowledge of semiconductor design or manufacturing.
It only outsources assembling of chips with no technological/design know-how.
Modi Govt WASTED â‚¹1571 crores purely for Modi's foreign PR

"Yes it is indeed a great deal for Micon, with GOI and Gujarat Government putting in much much more than Micon.

"This looks like the public money has been misused for the loss of the country.
This is not a good deal for the country."
"From which angle?
What do you know about semi conducters?"
This only proves one thing that even if you have the money tech cannot be bought off the shelf. It is closely guarded & controlled by big corps & Govts. The Micron deal is heavily subsidised by GOI for low end tech raising eyebrows internationally. It may be a catch 22 for us

"For intellectual level of yours, even scrap collection is a high tech business. Aukat me raho bhai "
You yourself has mentioned that Micron is coming to take advantage of cheaper labor and reducing exposure to China. This itself explains motive of project. Employment and hurting China. You are working not for India interest but someone's else.
"first u shutdown tata project now running behind micron? foe god sake leave it. if they r generating jobs any how u dont take it, but leave it for someone else."
"I think youâ€™ve missed the long term impact of this investment in lieu of explaining short term expenditure. 

Validates Indiaâ€™s image as a viable investment destination, will ensure tech transfer to India of some kind which will eventually spur innovation in semi-conductors."

Semiconductor testing and assembling is not just cheap labour thing
Think of it to extract  dozen of chip made in wafer which itself in nm size ( need extra precaution ) 
And then put that chip need to be properly fit in machine to test it"
"Chips are not assembled they are fabricated on a board , it is process manufacturing not discreet. Process manufacturing cannot progress without tech transfer . China has been stealimg and exploiting this loop hole for years."
"Just check out who is the promoter or share holder of micron ,we may get clear pictures"
Be prepared for more shocks of similar nature. India will forge ahead with speed and vigour before you understand a bit of technology and business acumen of Modi.

"A bitter truth from Modi's US visit.

India's Micron deal follows a curious business model...

India will pay 70% of the cost but Micron will own 100% of the plant.

The total cost of setting up the Micron plant in Gujarat is $2.75 billion with both the central and state government providing for 70% of the cost and the remaining 30% or $825 million will be provided by Micron. 

So what does India get for investing $1.92 billion?

As portrayed by drumbeaters the plant will not touch core technologies of designing and fabrication of chips instead the plant will package, assemble and test chips that are fabricated elsewhere.

Paying 70% of the cost while offering land and cheap labour so that a US company can get 100% of the ownership, in a segment where countries like Malaysia are streets ahead of India, is not investing in technology. It is simply a PR exercise.

"#WATCH | Delhi: External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar says, ""If you see the recent US visit of PM Modi, you saw that there were many prime ministers have visited the US but this visit of PM Modi was different. It was because PM Modi has a different image. He is a senior, experienced and credible leader. When PM Modi tries something or takes a position, its effect is seen in global politics. In the last 9 years, we have seen big changes in the world initiated by India"""
Yes right because of Gujarat Riots.
Ask Barak Obama how different modi is.. and if your government is against him than speak about him
PM Narendra Modi must visit my state Manipur and stop the war. If he can ask Ukrain and Russia to stop the war for few days while Indian Citizen are being evacuated. Why he did say a single words about Manipur?
Aptly stated.
"So true  @DrSJaishankar 
Especially  in the middle east.

They will be the new Europe"
"Well said, also the US is expecting him to be around for a while."
There is no better image for Modi ! USA wants to sell arms and weapons to india ! They know pleasing Modi will lead to a huge deal and extra price just like Rafael deal!
Lousy bloody tweets
Mr EAM @DrSJaishankar the US in 1970s wooed China to counter Soviet Union & to the detriment of India. Now US has no option but come seeking India as China has become a Frankestein for US. US & China are the greatest self-servers & biz with them means verify but be wary of trust.

Despite all adversity and propaganda Modi has ultimately emerged as a statesman with intellect &  credibility at Global Level
Yes. For e.g Manipur.
Heâ€™s talking about image and not facts. How funny for an EAM.
Totally different.  Teleprompter was installed in White House first time. Modi has answered only one question in the first press conference during his nine years tenure. Investigating in a girl child is very important.
"Why so much buttering? Was he born yesterday? Has he not seen how Nehruji, Indiraji, Rahulji & Manmohan Singhji were received in USA & other countries?

Btw, this Viswa guruâ€™s graph is going down day by day. He is only popular with ED , CBI, etc."
Modi was denied visa. Reason still valid.
"It was a different visit in terms of embarrassment and a bitter after taste once he returned.

Embarrassment because of the funny things he said.

Bitter after-taste because his ministers trolled Obama and the journalist who asked him a genuine question."
Koi alag star nahi tha...visits by Nehru ji Rajeev ji and Manmohan ji were more decorated and fruitful...
Stop lying @DrSJaishankar
Teleprompter is a huge difference
"The shining moment of the visit is the respect and honour bestowed on the female journalist by our most cultured and civilized society who asked one question to our honourable P.M. 
Unparalleled respect to the 4th pillar of democracy. Goosebumps, tears of joy on our society."

"What is so different? What is the initiative of the India world acknowledging ? 
@DrSJaishankar"
"S Jaishankar,  You're not elective leader how can we believe that You're working for Nation. For concern of people you're diplomat appointed as External Affairs minister from RS . NOT LOK SABHA WHERE PEOPLE CHOOSE"
"What did India get in return? Dollar at 82 against rupee. 
India is buying drones rather than make in India drones."
"You are right, no one investigates in India like the way PM Modi investigates in India"
The word is megalomaniacâ€¦
Maybe EAM just woke up - see this reception of another PM and image as well.
Let's not be parochial to undermine other PM's visits.The difference is that they never wanted to integrate with a specific US regime to go to the level of even campaigning in US elections. Every visit was unique with some crucial deals signed and bilateral bottlenecks addressed.
"Correct and that's why over 70 congressmen and women did not attend the session and send letters asking Biden administration to question modi on his human right record isn't it?

Propaganda works only upto a point and now after 10 yrs everyone realizes it & r changing their view"
"@narendramodi bahut mahaan hai. Ab janta kaa b Soch lo thora.
Manipur is in worst condition & nobody is concerned about them.
J&K is totally failed by centre indirect governance, not able to conduct exams of jobs, electricity crises, without assembly elected members since 2018"
"Yes, this time it was different, he faced the media and answered a question. At least he answered to one question. Of course, thatâ€™s a big deal."
Laudable Lassen
"We see such speech as .
Extension tactics..!"

"Manipur is burning, when will he try and takes a position? Stop andhbhkati man."
"Defending the undefendable degraded soul? Justifying lies spoken at first 2 questions only pc?
Insulting the learned, dedicated experienced leadership in India."
Good Joke...
Are bhai ANI walo thoda sound badhao yaar... headphones me bhi sunayi nahi deta 
Bahut ho Gaya Bhajan.
"Yes , it was different.
All the PM s are welcomed by US citizens not migrants or any event management company."
"Yea it's different. He was the only Indian PM on the official US visit who was questioned by international media regarding worsening media independence, state supported atrocities on minorities and attack on democracy. 

Never happened before. It's definitely a first."
This is called bootlicking
Sir itni padhai likhai kar ke aapne chaatne ki naukri le li?
Manipur too waiting for hiim. It has been 2 months. All these tall claims of setting the world agenda sounds very hollow when one fails to keep one's own house in order.
I can't believe that some people in replies here are taking this speech seriously 
Kuchh nahin bus Modi ji ne angreji mein b@kÂ©hod! karane ke liye bheja hai ise
"And Mr. Minister ! Here is what the Honâ€™ble PM, had said about Climate Changeâ€¦. Lest you have forgotten!!@DrSJaishankar"

Modi ji has initiated big changes in the world in last 9yrs  ..jaise ISRO ka chandrayaan
Chamchagiri 24*7
"PM Modi is Global Leader, He believe in ""Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam "" ."

What rubbish
What is the effect the world has seen because of Mr. Midi's position? Has the ukraine war stopped? Has sri lanka implemented 13th amendment giving equality to tamils? Has China restored to its original position on the border? When will this bluff and bluster by our EAM end?
"He's foreign minister and Rtd.IFS officer but still he could not able to understand the pulse of other countries

They strongly delivered the message to India through Brack Obama who's strong ruling party leader. That's how US used to send the message

what a pathetic leaders"
Is his wife Chinese?
The poodle speaks !!
Nityananda is much better in clarity
Overpriced drones will buy you anything
Let there be a statutory limit on flattery. In terms of numbers and also in terms of length.
Please visit Manipur as well.
"He is more proactive in global politics, but FM should remember INC laid down the foundation of social, economic, and political infrastructure that is being used by the PM Modi, PSEs/PSBs and nuclear plants and missiles, Modi is privating were created by INC, don't forget fathers"
Don't spoil your image by sycophancy
