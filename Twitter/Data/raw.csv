101,Saket Gokhale,"SHOCKING!
Modi Govt used ₹1751 crores of public money to enrich an American company for Modi's PR:

During his US visit, Modi signed a deal with the firm Micron for establishing a facility in Gujarat

The deal is worth $2.7 bn i.e. ₹2274 crores

But here's the catch 

(1/6)"
102,Saket Gokhale," The Micron deal is merely for assembling & testing semiconductor chips

 Assembling requires ZERO technological knowledge or transfer. It contributes NOTHING to India's semiconductor vision

 Micron benefits from cheap Indian labor & reduces its China exposure

(2/6)"
103,Saket Gokhale,"But Modi Govt has shockingly subsidized & enriched Micron from public money:

 Of the ₹2274 crore deal, govt will contribute 70% i.e. ₹1571 crores

 Micron will contribute 30% i.e. ONLY ₹682 crores

And yet, Micron will OWN 100% of the plant with ZERO govt stake

(3/6)"
104,Saket Gokhale,"Therefore,

 Micron gets to reduce its chip assembly costs & its business risk from China. This allows Micron to make extra millions in profit

 India gets to ONLY assemble the chips i.e. no technology transfer & no specialized knowledge

Who benefits: ONLY Micron

(4/6)"
105,Saket Gokhale," Despite investing 70% i.e. ₹1571 crores of public money, India will get ZERO stake in the Micron plant

 Micron gets 100% of an Indian plant worth ₹2274 crore ONLY by paying ₹682 crore

Why is the Indian exchequer losing ₹1571 crores to favor a private US company?

(5/6)"
106,Saket Gokhale,"Contrary to claims by Min @AshwiniVaishnaw, this plant does NOT benefit India's knowledge of semiconductor design or manufacturing.

It only outsources assembling of chips with no technological/design know-how.

Modi Govt WASTED ₹1571 crores purely for Modi's foreign PR

(6/6)"
107,Saket Gokhale,"For more details, check out this insightful article by Prabir Purkayastha of @newsclickin in @asiatimesonline:"
108,Saket Gokhale,None
109,Saket Gokhale,"Correction in calculation (that makes this deal even worse):

 Deal is $2.7 bn i.e. ₹22,740 cr

 Modi Govt is funding ₹17,510 cr using public money for ZERO stake in the plant

 Micron is paying ONLY ₹6820 cr & getting 100% ownership

Loss to taxpayers: ₹22,740 crores"
110,VagaBong,"I don't mind the nature of the factory - if it's low-knowledge high-labour, so be it. We have abundance of labour. What bothers me about the deal is the skewed equity to ownership ratio. There's something seriously wrong there and needs a deep dive."

India's Micron deal follows a curious business model...

India will pay 70% of the cost but Micron will own 100% of the plant.

The total cost of setting up the Micron plant in Gujarat is $2.75 billion with both the central and state government providing for 70% of the cost and the remaining 30% or $825 million will be provided by Micron. 

So what does India get for investing $1.92 billion?

As portrayed by drumbeaters the plant will not touch core technologies of designing and fabrication of chips instead the plant will package, assemble and test chips that are fabricated elsewhere.

Paying 70% of the cost while offering land and cheap labour so that a US company can get 100% of the ownership, in a segment where countries like Malaysia are streets ahead of India, is not investing in technology. It is simply a PR exercise.
